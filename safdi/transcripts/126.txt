Preventing dementia
Episode: 126

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome back to the Evidence-Based Podcast on Wellness. I'm Dr. William Renner, board-certified in internal medicine and radiology, here with Dr. Alan Safdie, board-certified in internal medicine, GI, and nutrition. Dr. Safdie has been involved in more than 1,000 medical research studies. Today we're talking to a topic close to my heart, dementia prevention. All right, Alan, tell us about preventing dementia. Bill, you know, first of all, how common is this disease? I mean, do you realize how many people in the United States have, what do you think, how many people in the United States have dementia? Over 65 years of age, say. I would say it starts out probably about 5% to 10%, and then when you get to 70, maybe up to 10% to 15%. Yeah, well, it's not bad, Bill, but 1 out of 9 have dementia. But dementia, and I think we underestimate that, honestly, because a lot of family doctors don't go through entire cognitive performance studies with each patient. I know mine doesn't. But cognitive impairment is much more common. That's about 1 out of 3 people. And, for example, problems with memory, attention, you know, thinking-type problems. Well, what are some common, tell me some things that people do that suggest they might have dementia. That's a good question. A variety of things. Memory loss. But just not memory, typical memory loss. Memory loss that disrupts your daily pattern of living. Like getting lost if you're driving to the mall or something like that. Yeah, things you've done commonly and you can't remember that, or learning new information, or repeatedly, one of the things we look for is repeatedly asking me the same questions, or difficulty planning something, or problem-solving. Or telling your wife the same story over and over. That's because she doesn't listen. But, you know, confusion with time or place, you know, losing track of dates or, you know, getting confused in familiar environments. And at night, a lot of these people start to wander. So they may leave their house, they may wander. So there's a variety of things you can look for, including poor judgment. People with cognitive impairment and dementia have significant problems, especially financial problems, and are the ones that people will often send emails to and they'll respond that says, you know, you can win $30 million if you give me your bank account. So be careful, you know, evaluate it. We evaluate people constantly. Cognitive testing is important. One of the interesting places you can go is AARP has a cognitive assessment that is very well done, and we use similar things in the hospital setting. Yeah, that sounds like really good advice. We're all of us should be testing our cognitive status. Yeah, I test mine, and I like doing tests anyway. And, you know, age match control you. So it's a test that you can do on AARP. AARP membership, I think, is $10 or $15. It's not very expensive. And it takes maybe 20 minutes or so to go through those tests. And I think it's worthwhile. And you're not really comparing yourself to age match controls, but yourself. You can see if you're declining in, you know, speed of processing, memory, short-term memory, long-term memory. So it's very good testing to do. What if you are declining? What can we do? So, first of all, I mean, you know, one of the things people ask me all the time, you know, we'll go through things you can do, including this new study on bicycling. But they ask, should I get my APOE4 status checked? Would you get yours checked, Bill? Yes, I've already had mine checked. Yeah. I'm not sure. You know, it's a tough question when people ask me that. Because if you are positive, I'm going to give you the same recommendations as if you're negative. And we're going to go through a lot of the recommendations I do. But if you're positive, you inherit one of these genes from your mom, one from your dad. Unless, like you, Bill, you were born in a test tube. But so you're either E4, E4, meaning you got one from your mom, one from your dad, or E3, E3, E2, E2. But the most common is E3, E3. And then you're about average risk for dementia. If you're E4, E4, you got one from your mom, one from your dad, you're 13 to 14 times higher risk of developing dementia. Yeah, that's a significant risk, 14 times more. Yeah, and it creates a lot of anxiety if I told you that. And I'm not going to, at this point in time, I'm not going to give you any different recommendations. If you said, I'll listen to you more, and I said, okay, and if you're not going to freak out if you get that back and you happen to be one of the E4 positive patients. But there are things that we can do. One of them is the Dean Ornish study, which we talked about previously. Do you remember that study? Basically. Tell me about it, though. Remind me. So Dean Ornish ended up with 51 patients, didn't start with 51 patients, with early Alzheimer's and cognitive impairment, and basically did a few things that I tell my patients always to do. A whole food, slant-based diet. That means you're not going to be picking up a box from the shelf that has 14 different ingredients. 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day, which almost anybody can do. It could be a walk. Doing some meditation or stress reduction or yoga. And social support or group meetings. So social support could be playing tennis, going for a walk with friends, et cetera. But after a year, and it was just, you know, the lifestyle group had better cognition and functional scores, so including speed of processing and other things. So that was a plant-based diet, exercise, stress reduction, and group support. Is that right? And your stress reduction may be taking a walk in the woods, you know, which you like to do. It doesn't have to be in a structured format. So, you know, one of the things in regards to exercise that we need to talk about, which is really new, is the Journal of American Medical Association had a study where they, well, published, the study was published there, of 479,000, somewhere around there, adults in the United Kingdom. So they're from the biobank. United Kingdom has very good data. And the average age was in the mid-50s for them. And after 13 years, you know, at the beginning, none of them had dementia. But so they looked at people that were using bicycling as a means of transportation versus driving, versus taking buses. So cycling, the interesting thing is cycling, which I love because I love to cycle, people who regularly bicycled had significantly lower dementia incidents than walkers, drivers, or bus riders. So why do you think that would, what do you think about that, Bill? Well, I like the idea because, for one thing, it's practical, right? Running's hard on your joints, but walking, you know, it's hard to get to your aerobic threshold, but bicycling, you can do it. And also it seems to me like it would help with your balance, which is a major problem with older people. People all work on your balance. See if you can stand with support, not by yourself, have someone supporting you. See if you can stand on one foot for 30 seconds. And always check with your, any recommendations we give you, check with your doctor. Check with your doctor. But one of the interesting things, bicyclists, when we look at their hippocampus, the brain memory center, just think of that as where you're storing all those memories and shrinks in earlier Alzheimer's disease, the cyclists preserved it better over time. So by bicycling, you were preserving the size of that hippocampus. You know, they retained more. Yeah, this is actually a function as a radiologist. I can see on your MRI scan. So both APOE4 carriers, the ones at much higher risk that we talked about, and non-carriers, and I'm a non-carrier, but non-carriers benefited even more. But even the APOE4 people that are really high risk showed measurable benefit. So why did it matter? Bill mentioned one of the things, you know, was balance. But it's multitasking. You know, what are you doing? Well, you're looking at traffic awareness. You're looking at your terrain. You're looking at your speed, your braking, your balance, all these things you're doing at one time. Whereas if I'm riding my Peloton in the basement, I'm looking at one thing. I want to beat the person in front of me, you know, because I think of it as a competitive sport. And the back end of the girls in front of you. Unfortunately, you can't see them. But, you know, but cycling requires micro-adjustments for stability, which it doesn't require on my indoor bike. So that helps the vestibular and cerebral pathways, the parts that relate to balance. Speed of processing is very important. And there's actually an older study that showed that cab drivers had a lower incidence of dementia because they had to use their memory and speed of processing. They were multitasking all the time. Those cab drivers in New York having to take cabs there. I'm not sure that study was real. I have some questions about that study. My last cab driver in Washington, D.C., when we got into a stuck in traffic, he drove up on the sidewalk for a while. But what else can
