The Longevity Diet
Episode: 120

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Runner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine. With me today, I have Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and nutritionalist. Alan, let's talk about nutrition. Let's talk about diet. What diet can make people live longer? Because everyone wants to live longer. What can we do to help that? Let's call it, you know, not a Mediterranean diet, but essentially a longevity diet. And it doesn't have to be a Mediterranean diet, although that's the diet that I follow. But, I mean, it definitely doesn't have to be a Mediterranean diet. You know, what are some of the benefits of the diets that we're going to talk about? Is one, preventing heart disease, you know, two, preventing strokes, three, keeping you agile, you know, movement and agility and balance. You're not falling, you know, reducing the risk of Parkinson's disease, reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, you know, protecting against type 2 diabetes. So, in a variety of other benefits, you know, and we don't want to spend the whole time talking about that. I mean, obviously we know about exercise. And, you know, that should be integral to any longevity diet or plan because, you know, exercise protects so many things, but it may protect your brain volume. You know, as we get older, sometimes the brain shrinks. And there was a study recently published about a month or two ago that exercise may protect brain volume by keeping insulin levels and your BMI level low. So, it helps protect brain cells. Now, how much did you exercise? We've talked about this before. In the past, we've said 21 minutes a day is kind of the optimal exercise amount, at least shoot for it. Do you agree with that? Yeah, I mean, that averages out to about 150 minutes a week, you know, I'd say 21, 22 minutes a day. But, you know, if somebody wants to do more, that's fine as long as they don't excessively overdo it and use exercise as a means of purging. And if somebody does less, don't feel guilty. Any amount is better than nothing. I mean, we have studies that even 10 minutes per day is beneficial, not as beneficial as 22 minutes a day, but even 10 minutes a day has significant benefits. And studies have shown that this exercise helps protect your brain cells. And part of the way it does that is by maintaining insulin levels in the right range and, you know, keeping the BMI down. So, we know exercise helps brain-derived neurotrophic factors, so your cells communicate with each other much better than what they would have. So, let's talk about some of the dietary things that we have. And, you know, it's a variety of things. You know, when do you eat? What do you eat? And, you know, what are we eating for longevity? And we have some data from laboratory animals and some data from humans. And we realize that there are certain key characteristics of the optimal diet, which is, you know, moderate to high carbohydrate intake, but the key is from non-refined sources. And let me emphasize again, when I say carbohydrates, everybody thinks, geez, he's recommending carbohydrates? No, from non-refined sources. And that means, you know, broccoli has carbohydrates. Whole grain, truly whole grain breads, not something that's just labeled wheat bread, which is predominantly white bread that comes from wheat, but whole wheat bread or whole grain breads or steel-cut oats and all those things, these carbohydrates and fruits and vegetables and things, but non-refined sources, meaning mono-ingredients. So if you're picking up broccoli, it doesn't have five other ingredients. Cauliflower doesn't have five other ingredients. Carrots don't have other ingredients. Sufficient protein, but largely from plant-based sources. It doesn't have to be 100% plant-based sources, but in every diet that people live the longest, whether it be Mediterranean or the new Nordic diet, or if we look at the Seventh-day Adventists, which are all plant-based sources, the Costa Ricans, the Okinawans, the Sardinians, you know, predominantly a large portion of their protein comes from plant-based sources and enough plant-based fats. So the plant-based fats can be significant. It can provide about 30% of your energy needs. So what could be a plant-based fat? Olive oil is a plant-based fat. Avocados have plant-based fats in it. Nuts have plant-based fats in them. And all very healthy fats. And one of the things that we really need to focus on is a daily period of fasting, meaning do we want to eat 24 hours a day, you know, right before we go to sleep and right when we wake up? No, we want to eat most of our meals within an 11 to 12-hour period of time. So that allows for a daily period of time where we're not taking in a significant amount of calories. So, you know, that's important. We don't sit there, you know, having a midnight snack with a bowl of ice cream may not be the ideal for longevity. If we look at the populations that live the longest, you know, they focus on lots of legumes, whole grains, vegetables, some fish, no red meat or processed meat at all, very low amounts of white meat, you know, low sugar or no sugar or refined grains, and good levels of nuts and olive oil and dark chocolate's fine, but don't, milk chocolate is not. It's predominantly sugar. So 70% and above. So, you know, we have lots of diet on these things. And as I said, you know, whether we look at the Mediterranean diet out of Sardinia and Italy or the Okinawan diet or the Loma Linda people with their seven-day Adventist or the new Nordic diet, you know, all of these are extremely important. And we have data on all this. So you can have a diet and an exercise pattern that definitely improves longevity. Is that the kind, you know, think about this. The best diets overall have a host of health benefits, including weight loss, heart and brain health, cancer prevention, diabetes prevention. You know, there's tremendous benefits to these diets. So whether, you know, you're talking about longevity, it's a healthy longevity. It's a longevity without significant chronic diseases. And that's what we really want. So, you know, whether it be stroke or cognitive decline, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, you know, obesity, you know, eating these kind of diets can stave off a lot of these problems. All right, Alan. Hey, a great, great lecture, great talk about diet and longevity. It's something we're all shooting for is a better diet, a better time for retirement or whatever. Hopefully a little bit more peaceful time in people's lives where they get to do things that they've always wanted to do. But again, another great discussion. If you like our evidence-based medicine talks, please subscribe to our channel and please tell your friends about our podcast. Alan, do you have any other final comments? No, remember, it's an entire lifestyle. It's, you know, the type of fluids we drink, the type of, you know, the amount of exercise we do, all four types of exercise, you know, whether it be aerobic exercise or strength exercise or balance exercises or agility and, you know, stretching exercises, whether it be yoga and other things. But incorporate all these things into one healthy lifestyle because what we want people to have is a longer and healthier and happier life. Sounds great, Alan. And I'm looking forward to your next talk. Thanks, Bill. Take care of yourself.
