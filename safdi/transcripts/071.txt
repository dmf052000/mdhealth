Doctor's Corner: Colon Cancer and Screening...Part 2
Episode: 071

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. I'm board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts featuring evidence-based medicine and wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is board certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology. He's written more than 300 clinical studies himself and been co-investigator in about 900 clinical research studies. This continues a series of podcasts on colon cancer, which I find fascinating. Today I want to talk about different types of screenings for colon cancer. Alan, can you tell us about that, please? So, Bill, that's a great question. Please listen to the podcast that we did previously. This is following up that. But colorectal cancer, there's a lot of different societies that have recommendations, American College of Physicians, American College of Gastroenterology, U.S. Preventative Task Force. So, you know, I tend to like, you know, certain societies better than other ones, ones that especially deal with this every year and every day. So there's different means of screening. But first of all, we have to decide who we're going to screen and when we're going to screen them. As we discussed previously, you know, people should undergo a colonoscopy at an earlier age and more frequently than average if they have a family history of colorectal cancer or family history of polyps. If they have a family history of hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome with multiple polyps called FAP or familial adenomatous polyposis or HNPCC, which stands for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. People that have inflammatory bowel disease, you know, so what kind of tests can we do? If you're average risk, I mean, the approved tests right now, you know, CT colonography, which is doing a CAT scan, barium enemas, which almost nobody does anymore every five years, colonoscopy every eight to 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is a shorter exam than a colonoscopy, only examines part of the colon every five years. And other tests are these FIT tests, annual fecal immunoglobulin tests, which is testing for blood in the stool, as well as stool DNA tests. And the one you see on TV all the time is Colguard, Bill. So there's, you know, we have a variety of different tests. In my opinion, some of them are much, much better than other ones. But these are current. Let's talk about the most important ones. Now, the fecal DNA test, Colguard, I think that would be a good test for my wife's mother, who's 92 years old and probably can't really, it's not easy for her to undergo a colonoscopy at her age. The prep would be difficult for her. For me, I think that the prep is nearly nothing. It just doesn't bother me at all. But I myself wouldn't even think about having the DNA test because, as I understand it, it only detects the cancer once you've developed cancer. The whole idea, isn't it, is to detect polyps early so you can prevent cancer. So in my mind, you're bypassing the whole idea of colonoscopy by doing that test. What's your take on that? Yeah, I mean, you're right, Bill. You know, which test do I personally have? I have a colonoscopy. Right, as I do. And as I said, I have polyps. I don't really know my family history. My father was an orphan. But I have polyps, so I have a colonoscopy every three years. And I say it really doesn't bother me a bit. I mean, I don't dread it. Or even the night before the test, you know, I find it really not that much of an invasive test. It takes one day, you know, one morning out of your life. You have to get up in the morning, go to the bathroom for a half hour. Then you go have your test. And I frequently take a long walk or even go to the gym after my test. So, I mean, I don't find it too intrusive. Well, what you need to remember with Colguard is it's not intended for somebody like you that's had polyps. It's not intended to replace diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high-risk patients. It's not intended for people with inflammatory bowel disease. What we use it in is people that refuse to have a colonoscopy often. But, you know, it's good for detecting cancers. 92% of colon cancers can be detected by Colguard. But what we want to do is prevent cancer from occurring so patients don't have to go through surgery. So these precancers, even large polyps, not little polyps like you may have had, but these larger precancerous polyps, it's only detecting about 4 out of 10, 42% of those. That's scary because we don't want to wait until you get cancer. So the reason we do Colguard on a frequent basis, you know, if we're looking at Colguard as a screening mechanism, is we do that every three years, not every 8 to 10 years as we might in somebody with a negative colonoscopy with no risk factors. Yeah, let me just mention here my understanding. Tell me if I've got this right. So the vast majority of colon cancers first become polyps. So first you have a polyp. The polyp grows, and as it grows in size, it has a higher chance of malignancy. If it's less than a centimeter, there's a very small chance of malignancy. As it grows, you have a larger chance of malignancy. And then the polyp grows even greater than 2 centimeters. You're increasing your risk of developing a colon cancer. And then that cancer extends down into the polyp into the colon. And if we do colonoscopies every so many years, by removing those polyps, we can markedly reduce the risk of developing a colon cancer. Is that correct? That's absolutely correct. I mean, it's one of the few organs you can get inside and look and remove things that could turn into cancer well before they turn into cancer. Not that all polyps turn into cancer, but they have the propensity, especially adenomas or these very flat, serrated-type polyps, have the propensity to turn into cancer. So if we can remove those in the precancerous stages, you go home, you don't even think about it. We call you with a biopsy, say, hey, it was a benign adenomatous polyp. I'll see you again in three to five years. If it was negative and you've never had polyps, I'll see you in eight to 10 years. With Coligard, unfortunately, it's going to miss, well, a majority of those polyps, especially the smaller ones. And so that's why we have to have you come back more frequently. If we wait until you get cancer, we may be subjecting you to it may be a cancer I can't remove with an endoscope. And so not only do we find cancer, which might have been able to prevent with a colonoscopy, but we're going to subject you to surgery because we can't remove it at that stage endoscopically. So it is a means for patients to be screened. If it is positive, you're going to need a colonoscopy. If it's negative, you need, you know, needs to be done frequently. But remember, it's not intended to replace colonoscopy in any stretch of the imagination for people that have any risk factors, any polyps in the past or anything like that. And it does have a false positive rate of about 12%, meaning it may be positive and you may not have anything. So, you know, 12 out of 100 people, it's going to be positive, but we really don't find anything in those people. So it can be negative when you have polyps. Eight out of 100 people can have cancer and it can be negative. And it doesn't prevent cancer. Our whole difference between the two is one can be diagnostic and preventative, which is a colonoscopy. We can not only diagnose polyps, we can take them out and we can prevent colon cancer. The other one is essentially waiting for the majority of patients to get colon cancer before we do that test. So would I use it? I think that brings up an important distinction of diagnostic. That's why as a radiologist, I prefer the patients not have a radiographic colonoscopy because many times we see things, we can't really differentiate a malignancy, a polyp from stool, adhere it to stool. So it becomes very difficult for us to separate a stool from a polyp. So the patients then have to undergo a colonoscopy. So really, to me, it's not a very useful test because it's just doesn't, its diagnostic accuracy is just not high enough to separate clumps of stool from a polyp or even from a cancer. What you're talking about, Bill, is a CT colonography I want people to understand. And that was, again, it involves radiation. It's a test that can diagnose things but often has a much higher incidence of false positives, meaning, as Bill just said, that you'll see things that you can't really differentiate as a colon cancer or not. It does involve radiation. It has to be done frequently. So, again, it is an option. If we do CT colonography, it's every five years. It's not something we tend to order. And remember, with the cologuard, something I forgot to mention, you can get a false positive from blood in your stool from lots of things, including hemorrhoids, because part of the cologuard is not just DNA, but it also involves looking for blood in the stool. And their algorithms are proprietary, but we've had patients that have had positives and don't have colon cancer, and the only thing we find are hemorrhoids in those people. Medicare does cover both of these tests. They are covered by Medicare, but,
