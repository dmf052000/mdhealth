Vitamin D...What you really want to know
Episode: 125

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, it's Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine and wellness. With me is Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is the author of more than 1,200 peer-reviewed articles and lectures in medical schools on nutrition and gastroenterology. Hi, this is Dr. William Renner here. I'm with Dr. Alan Safdie. We have a fascinating podcast today on vitamin D. Lots of new information. There's also, I'm sure everyone's aware of, there's a lot of conflicting evidence. Let's get Dr. Safdie in here and see if we can sort some of this out. The recent VITAL study, what did it actually show about vitamin D? Bill, this is really an interesting topic. Vitamin D is, think of it more as a hormone than just a vitamin. We can discuss how it acts that way. But everybody's heard conflicting headlines about vitamin D. One week you might hear it's useless. The next week it's the longevity molecule that we all need. A lot of this confusion, where does it come from? And it comes from studies that are designed not necessarily from what vitamin D does biologically. And sometimes the studies are too short. So not that they're bad studies, but when you have studies that are too short and the headlines say vitamin D does not prevent cardiovascular disease, vitamin D does not prevent cancer, total cancer incidence, that doesn't mean it doesn't work. That means it didn't work in the time frame that the study went on. So the study for approximately a five-year study, cancer may take decades to evolve. Dementia and neurodegenerative diseases take a long time to evolve. And five-year study, I actually didn't expect it to work very well in a five-year time frame. So what you're saying is that the duration of usage of vitamin D is what matters in many instances. Well, we think so. You know, that's why there's ongoing studies. We're taking the VITAL study, which was 25,000 people that were taking 2,000 international units of marine vitamin D for 5.3 years. So we want to continue to follow those people and look at cancer mortality. There was signals that cancer mortality, cancer deaths did decrease during the study. Did cancer incidence? No. So advanced metastatic cancer, there may be fewer metastatic diseases, fewer cancer deaths from metastatic disease spread of the cancer. So, you know. So you're saying it didn't prevent cancer, but once someone developed cancer, they had less chance of having spread of the cancer. Correct. But in this study, it didn't prevent cancer. Atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer unfold over decades. So I didn't expect there'd be a tremendous benefit in a relatively short study for long-term diseases. The cancer mortality curve started to separate over time. But if we follow that out for 15 or 20 years, it may be different. You know, we understand. I'll give you colon cancer as an example. We see polyps when we do a colonoscopy. That polyp may take a decade to turn into cancer. So whether it's taken out or not, if I did a five-year study, there may be very little benefit over the next five years for removing small adenomatous polyps. So studies sometimes have to be longer than what the VITAL study. It's a great study. It just needs, and there's continuations of the study looking at it. And there's a variety of other studies in regards to neurodegenerative diseases. All right. Well, let's talk about that then, the so-called aging clock idea. There's some recent studies that telomere length, which is linked, the longer your telomeres, is linked to longer age. There's some recent data about that in vitamin D. What can you tell us about that? Well, think of, you know, first of all, everybody needs to understand what the telomere is. So think of your shoelace and that little plastic cap at the end of your shoelaces. And when that little plastic cap wears out, falls off, you know, our DNA actually ages. Right, right. No, I love that analogy. You know, we're all familiar with that. Little plastic cap breaks off. That's the end of the shoestring. You know, so the telomere length, I get it. That's a good analogy. The longer the telomere length, the longer we're going to live. They protect our chromosomes. Right. And they shorten as we age. This gray hair I have, my telomeres are getting shorter. Can we preserve those? Maybe too long a telomere may be a risk, and we have to get into that on another podcast. But in the vitamin D group, telomeres shortened far less than placebo, meaning the inactive substance that they were given. And that equivalent to about three years of biological aging. So it was a good study. It was studied over a long period of time. And they looked at telomeres in the white blood cells. And they looked at them over a long enough period of time to see a difference in a two- to four-year period. Did fish oil or omega-3s, flaxseed oil, have that benefit? No, it did not. The vitamin D did. So could it be something that affects our biological age, not our chronological age, but our biological age? That brings up another topic I wanted to talk about, autoimmune disease and vitamin D. I've read some studies about that recently. What's your opinion of that? I mean, part of the subset analysis. So whenever you do a study, you have a primary goal. It's to study, well, does this prevent heart attacks? That might be a primary goal. Our secondary goal may be, did it prevent other diseases? And we would list out the other diseases we're looking at. In the VITAL study, there was a 22% reduction in autoimmune disease incidence. Not just, you know, aggression, but incidence, you know, development of those diseases, including things like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis and a lot of autoimmune diseases. You know, we look at vitamin D in regards to inflammatory bowel disease. And, you know, looking at a meta-analysis of studies, which is combining a whole bunch of data from a bunch of different studies, vitamin D reduced the relapse rate in Crohn's disease. And we know that deficiency may worsen. There's a barrier that we have, this gut barrier, this microbe, you know, so things don't penetrate that shouldn't penetrate inside of our gastrointestinal tract into our bloodstream. And vitamin D deficiency may make that worse. I wanted to ask about neurodegenerative disease, right? As we've said previously on this podcast, I've said that dementia is my greatest fear. I don't want to lose my mind. I don't care if I lose my body. I don't want to lose my mind. What can you tell us about vitamin D and neurodegenerative disease? Well, the first thing, Bill, is I'm glad you remember you said that. That's a really good sign. Well, I'm glad you didn't ask me about yesterday, but go ahead. Remembering is good. So we look at observational studies, which are not as scientific as, so they're kind of retrospective studies. We look back and look at people that have low vitamin D levels, and there was a higher incidence of dementia. Some of the studies up to 40% to 60% increase in dementia. Randomized controlled trials, looking forward, showed no benefit. And I didn't expect them to because those were too short, two to three years. We talked about these are diseases that may develop over decades, and we do a two- to three-year study. Maybe sometimes we have to look back and say the design of our study, it's designed so it's going to fail. You know, if you do a two-year study for a disease that takes 10 years to develop, it's a study that I'd be shocked if it didn't fail. So, you know, the other thing is, you know. I mean, I think that's one of the great advantages you have, Alan. Alan has actually done more than 1,200 clinical studies and has a great perspective on how do studies actually work and relate to disease. One thing I did want to ask you finally is what should people do? Now that we're talking about this, what should people actually do? So vitamin D is part of a lifestyle. You know, there's not a single longevity drug, molecule, medication. You know, doctors that write books and say the most important thing in the world is to exercise. That's one of the things that's extremely important for us to do. Sleep, it's important not to have a nightlight in your bedroom, you know, not to be exposed to a significant amount of light while you're trying to sleep because it changes your melatonin secretions. Yeah, my wife and I, we have black shades in our bedroom. It's totally dark. It makes it much easier to sleep at night. And we don't allow any phones to be on at night. Which is good. I mean, the phone shouldn't be in my bedroom, but unfortunately since I get called daily. Yeah, but everyone has phones in their bedroom. It is in my bedroom, but, you know, think vitamin D may reduce advanced cancer, may reduce autoimmune disease, may slow biological aging by preserving your telomeres, may reduce relapse of an autoimmune disease such as Crohn's disease, and some of the neuro, may slow neuroimmune diseases. But what you should do is get your, in my opinion, always talk to your doctor about anything that we're saying, but, you know, first test your 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and your doctor can do that. It's a very inexpensive test. And see if you're deficient. Because the dose you need, Bill, may be different than the dose I need. The dose that I needed, I mean, I've been taking
