Vaccine Update: J and J plus other Covid-19 vaccines News Today!!!
Episode: 084

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts focused on evidence-based medicine and wellness, featuring Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is board certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology. He's traveled the world to lecture on healthcare. Dr. Safdie was the principal investigator in about 300 clinical research studies and the co-investigator in about 900 clinical research studies. We're both still active in medical research. Dr. Safdie, today I want to talk about COVID-19 and vaccines. The latest Johnson & Johnson vaccine came out today, and there's also some other information on some other vaccines which are very important. But before I get to the vaccines, I want to remind everyone that it's going to be a while before the vaccines can save us, okay? It'll be some time. So more important than the vaccines, at least for the next several months, is distancing and wearing masks. Please man up, wear your mask. Alan, what do you think about that? No, I think you're absolutely right, Bill. This isn't going away that quickly. We continue. The more propagation of viruses you have. So if a virus enters your body, it continues to replicate in your body. And the weaker your immune system is, the more it continues to replicate and the longer it stays in your body. Each one of those replications has a chance of having a mistake, what we call a mutation. And some of those mistakes make that virus stronger, like a big bulky virus that can go around and get more people. The weak virus mutations, they die off, but the strong ones don't. So the more people get infected, the more mutations we're going to have. So people not wearing a mask is one of the silliest things we could ever do. Even after you had the vaccine, our vaccines are not 100% protective. Not one vaccine we have is 100% protective. So even though you've been vaccinated, I've been vaccinated, but we still wear a mask. And there's no chance I'm not going to because we don't even know that we couldn't spread the virus even after we've been vaccinated. But not wearing a mask allows these viruses chances for more and more mutations. And the mutations that live on, the virus's whole goal is get a better mutation so that it can live longer. And mutations, the survival of the fittest, the best viral mutations are the ones that spread. The weakest viral mutations, no, they're not going to spread. And if we've been wearing masks all along, we might not have had as many viral mutations as we have worldwide right now. All right, so let's all wear a mask. And I wear a mask if I'm outdoors riding a bike. Anytime around people in a park, even in an open park, I wear a mask. And a mask, you adjust to them. It's just like anything else. In South Korea, where everyone just wears masks, they've had just a fraction of the number of cases we have. All right, Alan, let's go ahead and let's talk about the vaccines. Johnson & Johnson was released today. What can you tell us about that vaccine? Okay, there's a lot of confusion about their data, and we'll try to go through that. But remember, we're at the beginning of this. We're not at the end of our research. This is a new novel virus. I mean, we've had 2.1 million deaths worldwide, 101 million infections so far. This is a devastating disease. And what we're looking at right now, we have currently there's 78 candidate vaccines. 20 of those are already in stage three clinical trials. 11 vaccines have been authorized across several countries. You know, Johnson & Johnson hasn't been authorized, but this week they will apply for emergency use authorization, or early next week, I'm assuming at this point in time. So their data was that, you know, after a single shot, not two shots. And again, you have to, the data was after that it was 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease. It doesn't mean it was 66% protective against spreading from one individual to another, just as the Moderna and the Pfizer's were. We don't know that you can't still spread disease. But the interesting thing, it's 85% effective after a single shot against severe disease, which is the most important thing. Maybe you'll have viral symptoms, but not end up in the hospital. When we look at just US data, because we didn't have some of these variants, the South African variant here in any great numbers, we don't think at the time the study was ongoing, it was 72% effective. So just looking at the population in the United States, and I would expect that to be slightly higher because you're taking out the South African variant where it may not be quite as efficacious. You know, it is a difference between the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines. But this vaccine is easy to store. It can be stored in the refrigerator, which is really important. And it's really, you know, we wanted over 50% efficacy. In the United States was 72% efficacy, worldwide 66%. That's great. But 85% against severe disease, you know, I am not discouraged. It's nice to have another vaccine in our armamentarium that will be much easier to administer, to transport, and give around the world. You know, I don't expect this disease to go away for some time. Hopefully we'll get rid of the pandemic. There still may be sporadic epidemics, and this is going to be a lot easier to get to more out-of-the-way places than the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, which the storage is more difficult and everything is more difficult. But those are 94% to 95% against moderate to severe disease. But, you know, at this point, what we're really worried about is B, you know, it's B.1, but it's the 351 variant, which we talk about, which is more contagious. But the mutations in that virus make the virus less susceptible to the antibody immune response, including antibodies from vaccinations. Although they work, the vaccines may work, they may not be quite as efficacious. So people, what Bill, you know, told you at the beginning is wear masks. It's really, really important in regards to this. So you have any questions about that vaccine, Bill? Yes. What about the deaths? Were there deaths in patients that took the vaccine? No, I mean, you know, we always excluded, you know, for one month after the shot. So you want to exclude the first month. So I'm going to give you data that's a month after the shot. So you want to, if you died a week after the shot, you probably got the infection prior to getting the shot. So we exclude those. If you died 10 days after you got the shot, you probably died from something you got prior to the shot. But if we look one month after the shot, when you have good antibody levels, all hospitalizations, not just deaths, all hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the placebo group, which is really encouraging for a single shot vaccine. Right. So no deaths, at least so far, no deaths so far in the immunized groups after one month, which to me is amazing. Yeah, I mean, it's not depressing. I mean, we're used to these 94, 95% data from Moderna and Pfizer. That's after two shots. After one shot with those, you know, we're not dealing anywhere close to this kind of efficacy. Now, there is a two shot arm of this. We don't have data. Will we get up to that kind of efficacy with two shots? We're not sure. But one of the encouraging things is you just mentioned after a single shot one month out. So once you get a shot, you're not protected. You have to wait two to four weeks to get really good antibody levels. You know, every death and every hospitalization was in the placebo group. And this was not a small group. That in itself is just amazing when this is such a deadly virus. Now, as I understand it, that vaccine can be kept up to three months in a refrigerator and you just use a standard refrigerator. It doesn't have to be frozen. Is that correct? Yeah, we can get this everywhere, essentially, that, you know, I've been to a lot of countries volunteering and there's some countries that might be difficult. But, you know, we can have coolers shipped to almost every corner of the world with this kind of vaccine. And what we're looking for is, you know, if we can get everybody to take a vaccine that has, you know, 66 to 72% efficacy, but more than that, 85% efficacy against severe disease, we will end up having that kind of herd immunity that we really need. And it's really pretty good for a single dose. It's an affordable vaccine. It's quite different than the messenger RNA models that we have, where in a messenger RNA model, you're getting RNA that tells your cells to make these spike proteins. So you're actually making the vaccine yourself. This is using a weakened cold virus, an adenovirus, to deliver the genetic instructions into the cells to promote the immune response. It's an adenovirus we haven't been exposed to previously. There are adenoviruses we haven't been exposed to. So there's going to be more data coming out with that vaccine. We also have an interim analysis, you know, from phase three data from other vaccines that are coming out that, you know, may look promising. So it's not just we're going to have a slew of data. The Novavax vaccine. Yes. Tell me about the Novavax vaccine. Well, we have an interim analysis, not a final analysis. So and their vaccine candidate demonstrated about 89.3% efficacy. They didn't, you know, in the Johnson and Johnson one
