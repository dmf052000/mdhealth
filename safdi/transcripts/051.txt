Missed Cancer Cases due to Covid-19.  More death and disease caused the by Covid-19 Pandemic
Episode: 051

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in what we think is the best podcast in America on evidence-based medicine. I'm joined today with Dr. Alan Safdie, famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine doctor who's had more than 30 years of clinical research and cutting-edge medicine. Dr. Safdie, I wanted to talk to you about the COVID epidemic and some collateral damage to medicine from the COVID-19 epidemic. We've had this for 19, we've had COVID-19 around for about five months, and some people are estimating that there may be up to 100,000 missed cases of cancer because patients are not going to see their physicians. Could you comment on that? Yeah, Bill, that's a great question. It's not just cancer, it's a lot of things. If we look at New York City, there's a dramatic surge in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Why is that? I mean, during the height of this pandemic, we've seen a dramatic increase in cardiopulmonary arrest and with significant fatalities as an outpatient. And we can't rule out the possibility that some people may have died from delays in seeking or receiving treatment for non-COVID-19 related conditions, or this may be related to COVID-19 in some fashion that we don't know. So it's either directly or indirectly COVID-19 responsible for that surge in cardiac arrests and deaths. Yeah, I think one of the problems is that people are just afraid to go to the hospital. They know that there's COVID-19 there. We see on the news all these little tents of people around there, the emergency room physicians greeting people, and people just don't want to go to the hospital. No, you're absolutely correct. Primary care practices are suffering because people aren't getting the requisite care they need. Some people, their diabetes isn't getting treated accurately, their blood pressure is not being monitored adequately because they have the fear, rational or irrational, of COVID-19 and picking it up in a medical setting, which is not common. We're so careful in a medical setting that that may be not a completely rational fear. So when we look at cancers, let's look at the five common cancers that may be missed or delayed. And we looked through early June. We don't have up to July yet. And we looked at missed cancer diagnosis, up to 36,000 breast cancers that have been missed, 22,000 prostate cancers, almost 19,000 colon cancers, 2,500 cervical cancers, and 450 lung cancers. And unfortunately, people are not getting the screening and monitoring tests for breast, prostate, colorectal, cervical, and lung cancer because it's down anywhere from about 40% to 90% from what it had been. And we know that in my field, and you know that also, that this either delay, misdiagnosis, or delay of diagnosis can end up with an increase in mortality. So there's a tremendous increase. If we project this out, there's a tremendous increase in canceled or delayed tests, up to 20 million for these five cancers. And we're just talking about these cancers. We're getting about the cardiac arrest that we mentioned before. And then catching up on this backlog of testing is going to be problematic. So I think that we need to better inform people how to get medical care in a safe fashion in this era of COVID, because it is not going away that quick. We've never passed the first peak to the second peak, because we're still in the first peak. We have an increase, and we haven't done well like most of the countries in the world have. Well, as you've advocated in the past, Alan, people are just not wearing masks, and they're not maintaining distances. People are going to bars, luckily. The governors of some states, I know the governor of Arizona, just closed down the bars and the gyms in Arizona. It should have been weeks ago. But if you just walk up to the park, there's very, in Cincinnati, Ohio, I walk to the park every morning. I may see one or two other people other than myself wearing a mask. The vast majority of people don't wear masks. The young people are jogging by you or next to you, aren't doing any kind of distancing. They act like nothing is going on, when in fact the hospitals are now being threatened, almost overloaded with patients, especially the ICUs. Yeah. We'll talk about that in a subsequent podcast of what we've seen in just one county. I'm out in Colorado, and in certain areas, people are careful right now. In other areas, people are absolutely not careful. In a grocery store, there's no excuse for everybody not having a mask on. We can decrease viral spread dramatically, and it's not just whether you're going to get it, but it's how much virus you're going to get. So we'll discuss that in the future, but we need to inform people how to get medical care safely, going in with masks, doing the hand cleansing. Just remember the WMD, you know, wash, mask, distance. You can get health care safely. You know, ask your doctors what they're doing to prevent spread within an office setting. Can you wait in the car until you're ready for your appointment and not sit in a waiting room with other people? Again, indoors are much riskier than outdoors, but we're very careful in medical settings to try and prevent any spread from the medical community to the general population. But the general population is not being as careful as it can in trying to prevent spread to other individuals. So this is important, people. Please listen to this. If you need to see a doctor, if you're having chest pain or discomfort or other symptoms that you would have normally called the physicians, go ahead and call your physicians. Go to the emergency room if you need help. They're still there for you, and you're much safer at the hospital than you are at home dealing with these serious illnesses. Do you have any other comments, Alan? No, I think that's great, Bill, and we'll discuss masks in a subsequent podcast and how much we can prevent spread of this virus and how come a lot of countries are, actually most countries in the world are doing better than we are. All right. Thank you very much. If you like this podcast, please tell your friends about it and click on it to subscribe to our podcast.
