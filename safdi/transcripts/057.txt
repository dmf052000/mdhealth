The medical facts about mask and masking
Episode: 057

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in what I think and what we think is the best podcast on evidence-based medicine in the United States. Today, I'm here with Dr. Alan Sapti, world-famous gastroenterologist. We've both been involved for clinical research more than 30 years and try to stay on the cutting edge of clinical research. Alan, today I want to hear your thoughts about masks. I know that back in March we talked about the excessive spray that can be formed from just the sneeze. And I know that there's some new data out there. And I wonder if you could give us your take on masks and the spread of COVID disease by aerosols and sprays. Well, thank you, Bill. I mean, this was an important topic in March. The U.S. government failed to make this an important topic like we did back in March. You know, we had data from MIT back then that says droplets carrying coronavirus, COVID-19, can travel up to 27 feet. Not six feet, 27 feet. And, you know, there's a very significant, when you exhale, you cause these gaseous clouds. And especially if you're running or biking or doing vigorous exercise, these gaseous clouds or aerosols, not these heavy droplets, can travel up to 27 feet. So if we're standing around people for 15 minutes outside and people are talking very loud or we're running behind somebody or biking behind somebody, this three to six foot radius is not probably adequate under those circumstances. If you just pass somebody and you're running, it probably is adequate. But we need to get people to wear masks. The World Health Organization, CDC, you know, as well as us, have been recommending this for some time. And we're not doing an adequate job explaining to people that even if you're six feet away, that may not be that adequate. You know, if you exhale very rapidly, the speeds that this exhaled gas can travel is 33 to 100 feet per second. And we're not taking that into consideration. So masks should be worn even if people are sitting around for long periods of time, you know, six feet away. Maybe we should have masks on even under those circumstances. Yeah, the other thing we need to consider is how contagious this disease is. You know, we know from an anatomic point of view that this virus actually has these little spikes on it, which presumably allow that virus to stick. And it's much more contagious than the previous coronaviruses. It appears at least several fold, maybe even 10 to 100 fold more contagious than SARS or MERS. So this is a very contagious virus. So these kind of dynamics, these fluid dynamics make much more difference in a disease that is so much more contagious. Yeah, let's talk a little bit about the six foot rule. The reason that came about was that droplets of saliva or if you blow your nose, the secretions from your nose or spit, these are almost like rain. You know, when someone sneezes, these larger droplets, gravity takes hold and they usually fall to the ground within six feet, almost within three feet. These are the more infectious droplets and they drop to the ground pretty quickly. We didn't take into consideration some of these aerosols that can spread even farther. So transient exposure to these aerosols is probably not a problem. If you get a million viruses, copies of a virus, and you inhale that, you're probably not going to get sick. If you get five million, you may get very sick. So let's talk a little bit about face masks in regards to what we just mentioned. You know, face masks have emerged as really probably our most powerful weapon along with distancing to fight COVID-19. I passed somebody today when I was running. They were walking in a whole group and I said, you guys should have face masks. They say we're distancing. I said, you're really not distancing adequately. They were actually walking next to each other. So face masks are the way that we can get ourselves out of this. But what kind of face mask, you know, should we be wearing? You know, a folded handkerchief may leak from the top. It may leak around the sides. It may leak from the bottom. And so there may be significant leak. Homemade face masks, a little bit better than the handkerchief. And they may, you know, off the shelf kind of, you know, they may leak a little bit less. And then the N95 or KN95, the Chinese variant of that, would even be better. So which kind of mask, Bill, you know, that you could buy, would you think is really the best that you could purchase? Well, I would guess the N95 mask is probably the best to wear. Is that right? Yeah. I mean, our KN95, which in all essence really have the same sort of benefits, the KN95 and the N95 mask. I mean, for all intents and purposes, one is a Chinese variant and one is not. When I go to the grocery, I wear the N95. And, of course, at the hospital, of course, we always wear the N95. And the N95 mask, these masks don't interfere with your CO2. They don't make you sick. They don't make you dizzy. All they do is protect you. So don't fall prey for there's some damage from wearing a mask. Alan and I, almost all physicians, we've been wearing masks most of our lives. And I've been in the operating room wearing a mask where I've been on cases sometimes that were extremely involved, transplant cases, that may have taken 15 hours. And I didn't pass out and I didn't collapse. So I really think that that's just a bunch of phooey. That's just complete nonsense that the masks are harmful because they're not. You might get a little rash around your face. I can give you that just from the secretions building up on your face if you're wearing an N95. But even people who are wearing these softer masks for shorter periods of times aren't even going to have those kind of problems. So let's talk a little bit about, and this is a little bit more scientific, and we can end with this just so people have an idea. You know, without a face mask, droplets, and these are some of the larger droplets, could project out to 12 feet from their source. Well beyond the often employed six-foot social distancing rules that we've had. The average distance was about eight feet. The problem is these droplets, the small aerosol droplets, can hang up in the air for three minutes before falling. Some of the aerosols can actually hang up a lot farther, and that's where we got 27 feet, the MIT study. The commercially produced off-the-shelf cone mask, the average droplet, if I sneeze, would project about eight inches. So we went from 12 feet or eight feet to eight inches. So they helped. If you did a bandana, remember bandanas leak a lot, they're thinner, the average forward travel was three feet, seven inches. If you folded the bandana and it was multiple layers of the cotton, it was one foot, three inches. The most effective mask, if you had quilted cotton, which is the kind I wear when I'm not in a hospital situation, which are just these quilted cotton masks, the forward travel of droplets went down to 2.5 inches. Those are very comfortable, soft cotton masks that everybody can wear. The softer they are, the more tightly it fits around the sides and above and below. And, you know, they're high thread counts. So take into consideration that, you know, without a face mask, whether it be eight feet, 27 feet, 12 feet, well beyond the six feet, you know, without a face mask, down to these just quilted cotton masks, which are very comfortable, 2.5 inches. So wear a mask, take into consideration that bandanas may not be the best alternative. That's what I use when I run because I can't really run very well with a mask, but I'm not near anybody. If I wear a bandana, I fold them so I have multiple layers. So I have a folded cotton handkerchief, which decreases to about 1 foot 3 inches. It's not just a single layer that I have there. But the other times, just go out and get a commercially made mask. I do like the quilted cotton mask. I think they're a little bit more efficacious than some of the ones that look like hospital masks that really aren't. Yeah, let's get the economy back. Listen, we all need the economy. We all want our kids and my grandkids, I want them to go to school. I want them to learn. I want colleges to open up. I want the businesses to open up. And the way to do that is masks, masks and distancing. We can get our lives back. Alan, thank you again for another wonderful discussion. If you like this podcast, please subscribe to our podcast. Tell your friends about it. And remember that Alan and I really get nothing from these except for the knowledge, knowing that we're trying to get as much evidence-based medicine and truth out to the people. Thank you, Alan. Thank you, Bill.
