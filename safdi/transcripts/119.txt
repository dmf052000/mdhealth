Vegan diets
Episode: 119

------------------------------------------------------------

Alan, today we're going to talk about different diets and what they mean and which ones are the healthiest. So let's talk about vegan versus vegetarian versus omnivore. First of all, explain what's a vegan diet, vegetarian diet, and omnivore diet. Good question. People are often confused by that. And there's other diets too. I mean, there's a pescatarian diet and we'll go through some of those things also. But a vegan diet is somebody that's excluding all animal products in essence. So that includes eggs, dairy, meat, chicken, all those things. A vegetarian diet excludes all the above except includes dairy and or eggs. A pescatarian is basically a vegetarian that also eats fish. Usually, you know, healthy fish. My wife being a pescatarian. In full disclosure, I've been a vegetarian for four decades. An omnivore diet is basically most of America. They eat both plant-based foods and animal-based foods. So are there benefits to these? Yes, there's benefits and downsides to each one of those. Let's start with the vegan. Tell me about that. And I'll tell you, you know, we both did internal medicine before we went into our specialty. And I recall seeing patients that had problems with vegan diets. In fact, one of my neighbors who played in the symphony orchestra in Cincinnati was a vegan diet and developed a B12 deficiency where he lost his sensation in his fingers and was no longer able to play. And he was basically disabled from vitamin B12 deficiency. So, I mean, that's one of the few things I know about a vegan diet. But tell me more. Well, I mean, you know, what we're looking at now is well beyond what we looked at years ago. You know, which diet has the best impact on gut health, on your microbiome, which ones have bacteria linked to colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. You know, the omnivores have more bacteria linked to those. Yeah, let me just remind the audience that the microbiome is the bacteria in our colon. And these are not just quiet little bacteria that are there and just part of our feces and don't do anything. They're biomedically active. They secrete hormones, peptides, neurostimulators. They have all kinds of products that they secrete and we absorb. So they actually become very important in our general health. Please go back and look at our previous podcast. Dr. Safdie has discussed this in great detail. Go ahead, Alan. Did you want to add something else? Yeah, I mean, so, you know, we just, you know, the microbiome, you know, you have one, you know, you have only 10 trillion human cells. You have 100 trillion bacterial cells. So we have to treat them well. So omnivores had more of the bacteria linked to colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. But let's go back to a vegan diet. Vegan diet we know has been associated with less type 2 diabetes, less certain cancers, less hypertension, less heart disease, you know, probably due to their higher consumption in the average of whole grain foods, fruits and vegetables. Their BMI tends to be lowered. But what can be the problem with that? And we'll get into protein in a bit. You know, it requires careful attention to getting in enough protein. Do they get enough bioavailable protein? I'll give you a recent study in a minute about bioavailability of proteins. But it's a struggle on a vegan diet. Do they get enough B12, iron, omega-3s? You know, are they adding chia and flaxseed to their diet, which I add to my diet every single day? I love it. You know, making sure their doctor knows if they're vegan so they can follow their B12 level, so they can look at their iron, so they can discuss omega-3 fatty acid ingestion. A vegetarian diet, again, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity. It's easier to meet the nutrient needs such as calcium and B12 due to the inclusion of these dairy products. I have yogurt every single day of my life and unsweetened. And it's easier to follow. It's something, and a pescatarian is even easier because they include fish in that. Downsides, one of the biggest downsides is there's some unhealthy vegetarians out there. They consume, you can be a vegetarian and eat very unhealthy foods and have more sugar in processed foods and still be a vegetarian. Yeah, I know some vegetarians who eat lots of pasta and they're overweight with diabetes, diabetic vegetarians. You know, it's hard to believe, but it's true. Well, even more potato chips, yeah, that's on a vegetarian diet. So we still have to be careful and look at processing of our foods. Omnivores, you know, and you can be a very healthy omnivore. It's much easier. You can get all the nutrients. It's easier to get inadequate amounts of protein. We know diets, especially in processed meats, are linked to increased risk of heart disease and cancer and other chronic illnesses. But there's more flexibility in an omnivore diet. So let's go through some recent research. One of the most fascinating things is those bacteria that live within us. If you have healthy bacteria, that lets you live a lot longer, we believe. And, you know, we propose that the gut microbiome, the stuff that lives within us, makes us healthier longer. It keeps our health span longer. And it's one of the things we've ignored. When you trained and I trained, Bill, we didn't discuss bacteria in the colon. We never discussed it whatsoever. Yeah, the microbiome really is only in the last 10 years that that word has even become part of the vocabulary. Yeah, I mean, it's very unique. It's like a fingerprint. You know, the bacteria you have and I have are going to be quite different. Tell me about the vaccine for losing weight. Doesn't that have to do with the microbiome, the possible vaccine they're working on? Yeah, well, what we're looking at is specific bacteria, and we're not at the stage of human studies with this. But when we put these specific bacteria into the lab animals, they really can't gain weight. You know, there's certain individuals out there that can eat almost whatever they want, and they just don't gain weight. Yeah, and you're one of them. I mean, you and I have been on cruise ships giving our talks, where you and I unfortunately spent 24 hours together constantly. And believe me, that was an ordeal for both of us. But you eat more than I eat, and on the same cruise, because I know we eat together, our meals were together, you would lose weight, and I would gain weight. So, you know, there's obviously some metabolic process. And everybody knows that. There's some individuals that eat more. Some individuals, depending upon the bacteria, you know, end up being healthier. So basically a healthy gut starts with your diet, though. You know, the cornerstone of keeping those bacteria healthy is your diet. And that does not include processed and ultra-processed foods. That includes, you know, fruits and vegetables and whole grains. And if it looks like a chemistry set on the ingredient panel, don't eat it. You know, modern diets are rich in salt, sugar, you know, fatty processed foods, and they damage our gut. And, you know, why do we have a lower health span than a significant portion of the world is because we eat these higher, you know, these type of foods that are not beneficial, and we're avoiding the higher fiber nutritious foods. We're not having as many beans and nuts and seeds and vegetables and fruits as we should. Yeah, it was the, you know, I'm a, whatever, I'm a vegetarian that eats a little bit of chicken and fish. And recently my family, all of me, and I picked up a chicken, a rotisserie chicken from one of the large departments, one of the large Kroger stores. And the chicken was, you know, whatever, but I developed a reaction right afterwards. And I looked at the ingredients, and there were 60 different ingredients, many of them were things that are not allowed in other countries. Unbelievable number of products for a rotisserie chicken, which I thought would have been a very healthy meal. If you make it at home, Bill. So one other thing I wanted to mention before we have to go is, you know, this fiber we're talking, it makes these good bacteria grow within you, is, you know, abundant in certain sites, you know, chia seeds, oats, flax seeds, tapioca fiber, carrots, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, sweet potatoes, beans, nuts, apples. All of those have this beta-glucan, which not only can help control blood sugar, but in mice, what it helped is found, you know, helped them assist in weight loss by eating those. You know, there was an article that came out, one type of fiber could have weight loss benefits similar to Ozembic. That is basically, you know, everything I listed is something I eat almost on a daily basis. So, you know, eating these kind of foods that are infused with this type of fiber is growing in popularity, and hopefully people will do this. But in the United States, less than 5% of the people in the United States consume the recommended amount of fiber, which, you know, is currently 25 to 30 grams. I think it should be higher. But we hardly have anybody. So 95% of the population isn't getting enough fiber to feed these bacteria that we need to feed that can keep us healthier longer. Alan, that's a great discussion. I want to hear about your thoughts about the Dean Ornish diet on the next podcast. That's become very kind of a hot topic because it's thought to be very helpful against many diseases, including even the treatment of dementia and cognitive disorders. I think that
