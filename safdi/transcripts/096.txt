Nuts: are they worth the calories?
Episode: 096

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts focused on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is a lecturer around the world and was the principal investigator in about 300 clinical research studies and co-investigator in about another 900 clinical research studies. Alan, let's continue our discussion on nutrition. Let's talk about nuts. I love nuts, just like squirrels love nuts. I love nuts, but I worry about the calories. Are nuts worth taking? Is it worth all the calories to eat nuts? You know, some of them very humble nuts, such as a peanut, which aren't truly a nut, which are less pricey, are probably definitely worth it to incorporate into your diet. We were told in the past, watch out for their high fat content, watch out for their caloric content. But it turns out nuts may be some of the healthiest ways to ingest a number of beneficial compounds that you can't get otherwise. They're prized for their rich, they have this tremendous cargo of rich things such as vitamins, minerals, monounsaturated fats. And even that humble peanut has those also, which is a legume. So the health benefits of nuts that we know of include enhanced cognitive function. What's that mean? Well, it may help in regards to preventing certain types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's. We know that it may also have heart, help in heart health. People who eat lots of nuts could well be lowering their risk of developing chronic diseases, including respiratory diseases and these neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes and cancer and heart disease. How do we know those things? You know, there's a lot of large studies that have been done and people who regularly ate even peanuts and other nuts were substantially less likely to have died of any cause, you know, any cause mortality, particularly of heart disease. You know, typically eating in general, you know, these nuts, you know, with our conventional American diet, our arteries become a little bit stiffer. But research has shown that even eating peanuts with their meals helps prevent the stiffening response because they blunt the, you know, after you eat what we call postprandial eating, they blunt some of the typical effect of the fats in your diet and they blunt that stiffening in the arteries. So in short, even eating peanuts keeps cells that line the arteries healthy by helping them to retain their elasticity. So, you know, what are the common nuts? I mean, again, most people know that peanuts aren't, we lump them into the nut category, but we have almonds and we have Brazil nuts and we have walnuts and pistachios and pine nuts and macadamia nuts and pecans and hazelnuts. And walnuts. Yeah, walnuts. Yeah. I mean, all of those, you know, are, you know, what we consider nuts, though peanuts technically are legumes like peas and beans. They're usually referred to as a nut because they're similar in nutritional profile and characteristics. And, you know, do they have a lot of calories? You mentioned that, you know, one ounce, maybe, you know, 150 to 200 calories, about 173 ounces, depending on, you know, 173 calories, depending on the nut. But they have a fair amount of protein. You know, a lot of them for that 173 calories have five grams of protein. They have good fats, you know, a lot of it being monounsaturated fats in it. They have a lot of magnesium and manganese and phosphorus and selenium. So they're very dense in that. You know, again, we talked in previous podcasts about the benefits of polyphenols. And these nuts have these polyphenols that can combat oxidative stress. You know, these free radicals that run around damaging our cells, they help in reducing this cell damage. And so, you know, walnuts may have a greater capacity to fight these free radicals than even fish. So, you know, it's not just walnuts. Almonds can help protect. Peanuts may help protect. So it's not just those. But nuts contain these antioxidants and polyphenols that protect your cells. And they may even help what we talked about before with other foods. They may even help protect against the damage that this bad cholesterol called LDL cholesterol causes. So how much nuts should you eat or how much nuts is beneficial without getting too many calories or too many fats? Well, you know, first of all, let's go back, step back. You know, there was a large study assessing the effects of the Mediterranean diet. And so the people that signed to eat nuts, so they were assigned to eat nuts, you know, not typically eating the nuts, but within their Mediterranean diet, they lost an average of two inches from their waist, significantly more than those just given olive oil. You know, almonds have been consistently been shown to promote weight loss rather than weight gain in controlled studies. So, you know, there are studies with overweight women. Those eating almonds had lost nearly three times as much weight and experienced significantly greater decrease in weight size compared to the control group. So they are dense, are quite high in calories, but your body doesn't absorb all those. If you eat peanut butter, you're going to absorb more of the calories than if you eat a peanut. If you ate almond butter, you're going to absorb more of the calories potentially than if you ate a whole almond. A portion of the fat stays trapped within the, you know, the fibrous wall during digestion. So it goes through your gastrointestinal tract and is not complete absorption. So, you know, the nutritional package of almonds may indicate like has 170 calories per se, but you may only absorb 129 of those calories. One of the benefits we found with nuts is they have density and fiber. They absorb fluid in there. And I eat them first thing when I get up. You know, one of the first things I consume, you know, with my oatmeal and my cinnamon and my blueberries and things are nuts. I will snack on them in the afternoon. And as you know, I eat quite a bit, but I don't tend to gain weight from that. You know, your body may absorb significantly fewer calories from walnuts, pistachios, peanuts than what you really think it's going to be. So, yes, you have to be careful. But, you know, eating an ounce of these nuts every day, I think, is going to be significantly beneficial. But again, talk to your physician before you make any changes in regards to your, you know, your diet, especially if you have metabolic syndrome or diabetes. But there are studies with type 2 diabetes, which affects hundreds and hundreds of millions of people worldwide. And so does metabolic syndrome, where we have, you know, obesity and diabetes and hypertension and all these risk factors secondary to report diet or weight gain. And nuts may be one of the best foods for people with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. So it's, you know, tremendously beneficial. And it may even affect inflammation using those as an anti-inflammatory. Nuts have a strong anti-inflammatory process. You know, inflammation of the body, the way it's defending itself from injury. So if you break your leg, it's going to get inflamed and swollen. If you get bacteria into an area, it gets inflamed and swollen. But however, sometimes that inflammation goes unchecked and it stays chronic, even when you don't have the acute injury. And nuts may reduce this inflammation and promote healthy aging. And this Mediterranean diet that we always talk about, people whose diets were supplemented nuts had a 35, you know, depending on the study, experienced 35% decrease in one of the markers, C-reactive protein. When we look at some of the more defined measurements of inflammation, it was up to a 90% decrease in that inflammatory marker, some of the interleukin-6. So, you know, incorporating nuts to decrease inflammation and be anti-inflammatory may be beneficial, especially for people with diabetes and kidney disease and other heart conditions. We always talk about gut health. It's a tremendous amount of fiber within there. Your bacteria need fiber. We don't need McDonald's wrapper. You know, the only fiber in a McDonald's cheeseburger is the wrapper. We need good bacteria that are good foods for our bacteria to ferment. And we end up with healthy short-chain fatty acids. And they improve our gut health. And improving your gut health can help in regards to diabetes and obesity. So most of these nuts, you know, have anywhere between about 2.5 grams of fiber up to 3.5 grams of fiber in one ounce serving of these nuts. So, Bill, I think, you know, they're delicious. Yeah, let's add them to the menu. You'd be nutty not to, right? Yeah. Go nuts on nuts. You know, there's a lot of it. You know, we have associations between decreased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer. But these fiber and vitamins and minerals may confer lots of protective vitamins, you know, protective effects. And, you know, I think that incorporating them into your diet may be reasonable. But, again, talk to your physicians about it. They have tremendous, tremendous potential health benefits. Well, Alan, again, this has been another great evidence-based lecture by you. And if the audience likes evidence-based medicine, please subscribe to our channel. Please tell people about our podcast. And stay tuned. I'm anxious to hear about the other lectures in this series that include plant-based omega-3 products, anti-inflammatory foods, and brain benefit foods. So stay tuned to these podcasts. Thank you, Alan. Okay. Thank you, Bill, and stay safe. Appreciate it.
