Multiple ways to boost your natural immunity during the Covid-19 epidemic
Episode: 039

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicines. Today I'm talking with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine physician, on improving your own immunity during the COVID-19 outbreak. As evidence that this is one of the best podcasts in all of America, look at the top of the screen. You'll see that we started our podcast on COVID-19 early in January, well before the government even recognized that it was a medical problem. All right, Dr. Alan Safdie, what can we do to boost our own natural immunity during this COVID-19 outbreak? I think that's a great question, Bill. I want everybody to realize that testing, first of all, is a key to slowing down the spread of the virus. We talked about that way back months ago. We're still going to be talking about that. The way to slow down the virus is testing, especially when people who contracted the virus can often be asymptomatic yet infectious. We've known that for some time, and we need to be diligent in regards to getting enough testing so we can open medical practices, do procedures safely, get people back to work, and do contact tracing once we find people that are infectious, and then find out who has antibodies. Please listen to our podcast in regards to the difference between looking for active infection and immunity by looking for IgG antibodies, yet we're still not sure how well the IgG antibodies are going to be preventative. Bill, before we talk about that, what percentage of people do you think that get admitted to the hospital have comorbidities, and what would some of those comorbidities be? Well, I would guess that I think it's somewhere around 10% to 15% of patients who have COVID-19 are admitted to the hospital. The comorbidities are hypertension, diabetes, heart disease. Those are a few of them. Did I miss a few? Of course, there's others like people who are on steroids or immunosuppressed, of course, that's a large group, people that have undergone chemotherapy or have some other reasons to have a suppressed immune system, of course, HIV infection. No, that's good. There's a couple big ones you missed in the United States. So we look at hypertension, obesity, chronic lung disease, people that already have lung disease, maybe even smokers that have undetected chronic lung disease, diabetics, cardiovascular disease, and you mentioned immunosuppression, chemotherapy, people on steroids. But if we look at hospital admissions, almost 90% of COVID-19 admissions involved having one of these underlying conditions among adults hospitalized. That doesn't mean people without those conditions aren't going to get unbelievably sick. They still can. But the sickest of the sick often have these underlying preexisting conditions. So one of the first things you can do to help prevent this and a strategy for wellness is if you have high blood pressure, make sure it's under control. If you're overweight, now's the time. COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon. So start working on your weight, getting your diabetes under better control. So looking at some of these comorbidities is really reasonable. And so prevention starts at home, what we're going to eat. So let's go through some of these. There is no supplement. There's no diet. There's no lifestyle change aside from social distancing and practicing proper hygiene that's going to protect you completely from developing COVID-19. I see people every day, and I'm sure you do, Bill, also, that don't practice this social distancing. Distance is our friend. If you're biking, you want even a greater distance. Runners, you want to be farther away from them than a walker just because they're breathing harder and they're going to spread it enough. So let's go through a few tips for strengthening your immune system naturally. Yeah, let me just throw in there wearing masks. Our governor has asked everyone to wear masks, homemade masks, if that's all you have available. Masks are now available to some extent on Amazon. You can order some three-ply masks. I just received 50 of them. It took me about a month to get them. They arrived from China, but there are some masks available on the Internet, unlike before. And I notice that where we are in Cincinnati, Ohio, almost no one is wearing masks. And as I look out on the street from my window here, I can see crowds of children, 5 to 10 children playing games. And last night in our neighborhood, one of the neighbors had kind of a little block party. And I just think that this is just bad decision-making. Many people believe that children can't get the disease. And I reviewed the data today from China as well as from the CDC website. And luckily, people are right. There are very few deaths in the United States and in China from COVID-19. But there have been a lot of sick children, and they've been very, very ill. So I think parents think that children are immune to the disease, and that's not true. We also know that children tend to be super carriers. They have the same amount of virus in their sputum as someone with multiple symptoms. So keep your kids under control. Keep them away from other kids and keep them away from adults. Protect older people especially. I don't know. Do you have any comments on that? No, I couldn't agree with you more. You know, nothing I'm going to talk about is going to cure stupidity. People are not practicing social distancing. They don't realize the dangers, what this is going to do to our public health, to our people with comorbidities, to our economy. So if people want to get the economy up and rolling, save lives, you know, practice social distancing. That's going to be with us for some time. It's not going away. We do not have a cure. We're nowhere close to having a cure for this. We're not even close to a vaccine. If we get one in 12 to 18 months, I'll be happily surprised. So let's talk about a few other things, you know, things that we always talk about. Eat more whole plant foods. So, you know, plants, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, you know, all of those have a tremendous amount of antioxidants. And they combat unstable compounds, these free radicals in our body. You know, I'm a vegetarian. I've been eating this way for many, many years. But fiber also helps. One of the most important parts of our immune system is our microbiome, those bacteria which live in our gastrointestinal tract. And those are what has to do a lot with our innate immunity. And a lot of our studies now we're looking into how healthy the microbiome is may relate to how healthy your heart is and your brain and your immune system. So fruits and vegetables and plants. Let me just remind listeners that we have several other podcasts on the microbiome, which has become a very significant part of medicine now. So listen to that podcast on the microbiome. Go ahead, Alan. I think the microbiome is a really extremely important part of medicine. It's going to become a more and more important part as we find out more and more about the microbiome. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. We've ignored that part in medical school. It's, you know, in most of you, you know, you think of poop as poop. 90% of the cells, not of the weight of the cells, but the cells in our body are basically in our gastrointestinal tract, these microbiome, our skin, our mouth. We know that even if we change the microbiome, the bacteria in our mouth, we can change blood pressure responses to exercise. And that's a huge part of our research right now. I'm going to move on to sleep. You know, all of us know how important sleep is. There's multiple studies showing that those slept less than six hours per night were more likely to get some viral illnesses. So, you know, we really ask adults to aim for seven or more hours of sleep each night. We don't want to sleep too much. Sleeping too much is bad. We don't want to be sitting that much. But sleep is really, really important. I put that down below the healthy foods. And healthy fats. You know, we talked about the plant-based diet, but healthy fats, ones that decrease inflammation. The omega-3s, which you get from flaxseed, nuts, you know, fish, especially the fatty fish like salmon and things like that, the wild salmon. Olive oil. All of these have high anti-inflammatory. They've been linked to decreased risk of chronic disease like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. They're powerful anti-inflammatories. So you can add chia seeds to your diet. You can add flaxseed. You can have salmon with that. You can have lots of nuts, but try to incorporate that. And we talked about the microbiome. You know, should you take a probiotic? I don't, but I have no qualms with somebody taking a good probiotic. And we've done podcasts and articles on probiotics. Make sure it has a good wide spectrum, not a single organism. But fermented foods are tremendous benefits. They have the probiotics. They have the bacteria. Things that are fermented would be like kimchi and kefir or sauerkraut, yogurt. So, again, we're back to looking at that healthy immune system that we get out of our gastrointestinal tract. And we have studies to show that those that take in more of these type of foods actually end up with less infections. Now, maybe it's part of their other diet. Now, one other thing in the diet, absolutely limit your simple sugars in your diet. Simple sugars would be white breads, cakes, cookies. These simple sugars can increase cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions. We have observational studies that people are more likely to get ill. Even after administered the flu vaccine, we're more
