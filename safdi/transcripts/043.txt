Every Parent's Nightmare: Covid-19 Now Killing Children
Episode: 043

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in what we think is the best podcast on medicine today. This is evidence-based medicine. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, a world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine doctor, answering questions from our audience on COVID-19. Here's one, Alan. Are my kids safe from COVID-19? You know, that's a really good question, Bill. I see kids running around playing with all other kids, interacting with a lot of adults in the neighborhood, and that really scares me at times. They act like there's no disease going on. It's just like before. Well, we assume that with COVID-19, kids were largely spared. And most confirmed cases, a lot of the kids had relatively mild symptoms. That doesn't mean kids haven't died of COVID-19. But recently, in the United States and Europe, there's a troubling new phenomenon, which may occur even after the kids have COVID-19, which can involve their blood vessels, their heart, their skin, and their eyes. And it's a multi-system type of inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki's disease, which nobody really knows what Kawasaki's disease is because it was first characterized back in the 1960s. And back then, we called it the mucocutaneous lymphoid disease. But we're starting to see similar symptoms in kids. And how do we know it may be caused from COVID-19? Either we can find the antibodies in the kids, or we can find the active antigen, so they have an active infection. So, you know, they may have a fever for five days. They don't have the classic respiratory symptoms. They may have redness or swelling of their hands, the soles of their feet, peeling of skin, diffuse rashes, redness or cracking of the lips or tongue. They may have redness of the eyes. And unfortunately, this disease can involve the arteries and cause inflammation in the arteries, which is quite scary. So it's a good reason to consider making sure that your kids practice social distancing as well as the parents. So this can involve kids. Remember, it's a novel virus. And every day we're finding out new information on this. And this is just getting published right now. We don't know what percentage of kids are going to have this. Right now, we think it's relatively rare. But in Kawasaki's disease, it definitely can involve arteries. There can be shock associated with that. You know, recommended treatment often was to give immunoglobulin, at least in Kawasaki's disease. So if your kids get sick, don't assume, especially when there's COVID in your area, if they're having a lot of these symptoms that I mentioned, you know, talk to your pediatrician. Don't assume that it's your typical viral illness that we had seen previously with kids. The New York State Department of Health states that there's been 64 reported cases. Cases have also been reported in Louisiana, Mississippi, and California. And there's at least 50 cases reported in Europe, including Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain, and Italy. So while it's uncommon, it seems like it's a real threat. And as you said, toxic shock, which is very low blood pressure, may be and is often a very dangerous condition, is often part of this syndrome. I think that there's only been one reported death so far. So let's just, I agree with you, we really need to keep an eye on this. And they need to start taking, people with kids need to start taking this disease seriously. You know, remember back a few months ago, there was only a few recorded cases of COVID-19 when we first started doing our podcast. In fact, there weren't any in the United States at that point. Right, and no deaths in the United States when we started our podcast. So we're just starting to see this. So look out for your kids with rashes, red eyes, swelling, extremity pains, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, you know, all of those things, and shock. And this may be, you know, because we didn't look for it previously, this may be more common than what we thought. Same as COVID-19, we're finding earlier and earlier cases of COVID-19 that existed well before we ever were looking for it. So people and adults had died and they were thought to have died of something else. And retrospectively looking at those cases, we're finding some of these patients actually had COVID-19. So be really careful with your kids, you know, especially if somebody in the family has it or people in the neighborhood. And I think, as you said, Bill, taking this very, very seriously is important. Yes, I think the death rates in the United States are way underreported. If people die before they get to the emergency room, they're not included in the deaths. People are not, they're not routinely doing tests for COVID-19. And in some areas of Europe, they reported 20% of the people died before they reached the emergency room. So just take this disease seriously. It's nothing to shrug off. All right, thank you, Alan, for this great and really important report. If you like our podcast, please subscribe to our podcast. Please tell your friends about them and keep listening. Thank you.
