Bio-Hacking...improving our health
Episode: 130

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie. We are happy to host this evidence-based medical podcast on wellness. We're both acclaimed board-certified physicians. Today, we're going to be talking about a very interesting topic, biohacking, hacking your body to make it function better. Alan, first start by telling us what's the definition of biohacking. Unfortunately, Bill, it's a very broad definition. So let's define some of the things that people will be familiar with. Intermittent fasting, ketogenic diets, vegan diets, wearables, continuous glucose monitoring, extreme things, whether it be hyperbaric oxygen or microdosing psychedelics. And are there adverse effects to these and are there benefits to these? It's a lot of things we'll be discussing in this series. Sure, there's biohacking, time-restricted eating has some metabolic benefits, especially in our lab animals. Cold exposure depends on the age. Younger people that don't have cardiac disease, it may reduce inflammation markers, may improve mood. Heat exposure, saunas, there may be a decrease in all-cause mortality, but we have to approach these things very carefully. Sleep optimization is absolutely necessary. I don't really want to call that a hack. It's something that all of us should be doing. Continuous glucose monitoring, not just in diabetics, but even pre-diabetics, may be helpful in deciding what is the best things for you to eat that cause least spikes in regards to your glucose. So the first thing you have to realize is a lot of these things do not have controlled human studies, large human-scale studies, like NAD+, being recommended. We don't have any large studies for that. We don't have any large studies for extreme cold plunges beyond simple cold exposure. And can they have toxicity? We'll talk about fat-soluble vitamins and iron overload, unregulated herbal interactions. Some people get hypoglycemic. Some of them have significant muscle wasting or sarcopenia with these. So there's a variety of potential benefits, and there's a significant potential for harm. All right. Well, since you're one of the world's experts in gastroenterology, I thought we'd start off with discussing maybe liver cleansing, colon cleansing, and then something about natural ways you can increase your own GLP-1. Alan, do you want to start with liver cleansing? Yeah. I mean, that sounds very reasonable because it's very popular. You know, when I'm listening to the news, driving back and forth from work, I hear multiple ads about, you know, take this to cleanse your liver. Your liver works hard for you, so it needs some love back, essentially. So what they're claiming is it detoxifies and cleanses the liver. You know, it heals the fatty liver. It improves your liver enzymes. And it's a variety of things that people recommend, whether it be milk thistle or dandelion root or turmeric or a proprietary blend, usually a proprietary blend of different herbs. So, you know, what I want to say is liver cleansers are not uniformly harmful, but definitely not uniformly safe in regards to that. So there's a lot of liver cleansers out there. It's a trend in health care. How to keep your liver clean and clear. You know, first of all, there's no evidence that liver cleansers work. And I will put that to bed very quickly. There's zero controlled studies showing liver cleansers work. These fall into the supplement category. The products are marketed, contain a variety of ingredients, and a little bit of information in the wrong hands can be a problem. Yeah, to me, it was always in the same category as selling snake oil. They're just trying to manufacture their own... That's true. I mean, you're right. I mean, you're selling something. Snake oil, in some sense, may be less harmful than some of the things. You know, let me give you an example. Turmeric. It's a popular anti-inflammatory. It's a very healthy herb. I cook with it all the time. But lately, we've seen substantial liver injuries, secondary to that, when combined with high doses and black bioprene pepper. So, you know, whereas we might give people 500 milligrams total, people are taking 2,200 milligrams at times. And it's doing the opposite of what's, you know, intended to do. It's harming other ingredients commonly used in these include fruit and vegetable juices. Please eat your fruit. Don't put it in a supplement. But the liver doesn't need them to function properly. The liver is a very significant regenerative organ. You don't want to be obese. We want to exercise. We want a healthy, unprocessed or minimally processed food diet. We don't want ultra-processed foods in our diet. You know, dandelion root, artichoke are very popular. And, you know, we don't have large, rigorous studies to show they may be beneficial. And then these things that people call liver flushes, you know, you're not going to get gallstones out that way. You know, large amounts of olive oil can have significant side effects. That much oil at one time. Oil decreases gastric emptying. So your stomach doesn't empty very quickly when you take large amounts at once. It does not, absolutely does not cleanse the liver. It does not get rid of gallstones or common bile duct stones or stones that are stuck in the drainage tubes of the liver. And then things that people use, you know, such as Epsom salts. You know, that much salt at one time can cause a significant problem. So people are somewhat misinterpreting some of the, you know, literature that we read. And, you know, some of these things can cause significant, significant acute liver injury. And, you know, are they all harmful? No. You know, regulation would be nice. I don't think we're going to see it. You know, it's because these are listed as supplements and they can make all kinds of claims that we're cleansing your liver. But you actually are not cleansing the liver. And you're putting your liver at potential harm. Hopefully they're safe, the ones you're using, but there are potential harms to these. Yeah, to me, the best thing you can do is cut back on your alcohol intake and avoid these so-called liver cleansing biohacks to keep your liver safe. Yeah, I mean, people have lived, if we look at the populations that live the longest in the world, they're not taking liver cleansers. You know, the major point is a healthy lifestyle will keep your liver clean. We don't need a supplement to keep our liver clean. We need our weight control, you know, weight close to our ideal body weight. We need a healthy diet such as a MIND, M-I-N-D type diet, which is an offshoot of a Mediterranean diet or a Mediterranean diet or a healthy Nordic, new Nordic diet. We need to exercise. I mean, if there's one drug that we know that does work, it's exercise. It's not a drug, but one methodology to work. And if you have diabetes, we have very effective ways of managing prediabetes and diabetes now. And we have very healthy ways of, you know, managing hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol. And, you know, it's not, unfortunately, those are prescription methodologies for some of these. A lot of them are diet methodologies. But there's no magic pill to cleanse your liver. The best liver detox you can get is healthy eating, exercise, and you said avoiding significant alcohol consumption. And you're going to have tremendous benefits to that. Well, Alan, that was a great topic. Let's come back for our next one. I want to hear on your next session about colon cleansing and if there's any benefit to that. That sounds good, Bill. And go eat a healthy diet. All right.
