Hot diggity...why are hot dogs bad for you.

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine and wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is board certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology, a fellow of the American College of Gastroenterology. He's lectured around the world and was the principal investigator in about 300 research studies and co-investigator in about 900 peer-reviewed clinical research studies. Dr. Safdie, thank you for joining me today. Let's talk about hot dogs. There was some recent publication, CNN I think put a little ad out, a little talk about how bad hot dogs are. How bad are they? Well, Bill, I'm a vegetarian, so honestly I don't eat them and I probably won't. So, not for the last 40 years. Anyway, you know, it's not just hot dogs. And this article, CNN picked it up and honestly did a good job sensationalizing just about hot dogs. But what we're really talking about is food products categorized as processed meats, whether it be hot dogs or salami or sausages or cured bacon or salted or cured any kind of meat or beef jerky or canned meats. And a lot of these meats have significant problems. What are some of the main problems with these meats? Now you're talking about, are you talking about lunch meat that people go to the deli and buy lunch meat? Is that a processed meat? That would be a processed meat. Okay, so the things that, all right. But a hot dog wouldn't, a sausage might not be, you know, a lunch meat. A salami definitely would be, ham often would be. You know, we're not talking about fresh beef and all these considerations. What we're talking about processed meat. And we've known for some time, you know, I did a talk years ago and you might have even been there when I was talking about death by bacon. Yeah, I remember. That was very popular. I think the title scared everybody. Popular unless you happen to be somebody that eats bacon. Although I think the nurses are still eating bacon, but they talked about it for a while. We've known for some time the Mediterranean diet is, you know, probably one of the healthiest diets, that or the new Nordic diet. But diets that are predominantly plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables and whole grains and legumes and nuts. And they limit red meat to no more than a few times per month. They may eat fish and poultry twice a week, but, you know, they really don't have red meat. And if you remember back, you know, and this was a couple years ago when I did that lecture with the nurses. And this was a study from a few years ago before the recent study we're going to talk about. But people who consumed about one serving of red meat, especially processed meats, had a 13% increased risk of mortality compared with those eating very little meat. And processed, you know, the very processed meats raised the risk to about 20%. So, you know, one theory is that the iron in the meat works as a catalyst to turn nitrites, you know, that we have into a preservative, some particular kind of carcinogen in the body. Growing these meats, you know, even the unprocessed ones on an open flame, explains part of the increased risk. You're not only getting the nitrites, but you're also getting formation of carcinogens by cooking meat at high temperatures with direct contact with the flame. So, you know, those are a couple of the things that, you know, we knew in the past. So this new study, you know, was looking at hot dogs specifically. And, you know, CNN published it, but it was published previously. It came out of the University of Michigan, actually. And it was in the Journal of Nature Food. But anyway, they looked at 5,853 foods in the U.S. diet and measured their effects in minutes of healthy life gained or lost. So you may gain stuff with blueberries. You may gain minutes with, you know, other foods. But, you know, we're talking about their conclusion was eating a single hot dog could take 36 minutes off your life, which doesn't sound like a lot unless some people have consumed 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 hot dogs. And it's not just taking minutes off your life. It's the morbidity that we worry about. Are we predisposing people with strokes? They're not dying. But, yes, we may be. Or cancers and the therapies that cancers may involve. So they actually came up with an index that calculates the net beneficial or detrimental health burdens associated with servings of these different foods. Well, I mean, as you know, I'm kind of a quasi-vegetarian. I eat poultry and fish. And the World Health Organization came out a while back and gave a warning for people who ate beef. And it had to do with pancreatic cancer, as I remember. Is that correct? Well, you know, pancreatic cancer is interesting. You know, it was something when we started, Bill, it was not one of the more common cancers we see. And now we're seeing pancreatic cancer much more commonly. And in several decades, it's probably going to be the number two or three cancer that we're seeing. And part of this has to be environmental. So, you know, manufacturers add nitrites and nitrates to foods such as cured sandwich meats, you know, your bacon, your salami, your sausages. It gives them color. It prolongs their shelf life. But both nitrites and nitrates can form nitrosamines in the body, which can increase the risk of developing cancer. Red meats in the United States may be different than red meats. You know, there's a different – I hate to categorize red meats solely into one category. I categorize free-range red meats that may be higher in omega-3s that are not, you know, not fed grains but actually can have free-range and eat grass and other things. A lot of them now to get around that, they say, you know, grass-finished or, you know, meaning, yeah, most of their life they fed them grains so they're not very healthy. And then at the very end of their life, they let them go be free-range cows out on the farm. So I hate to categorize all meats as ones that are grain-fed versus ones that are out to be free-range. The free-range ones may be healthier, but I do agree that, you know, we want to keep these nitrates and nitrites out of our body, especially when they're added to processed food and cured foods. And, you know, we don't even want them in the water. You know, find out if your water is tainted with nitrates or nitrites by looking up the water utility. So those are all things we should do, but it's not inconsequential, you know, by adding these luncheon meats to your diet. And most people aren't scared if I told them they're going to may live a month or two less by eating these kind of foods. They should be scared in regards to the morbidity, morbidity meaning the illnesses they can develop, but they'll still be alive. Yeah, I'll tell you, I'd much rather die than have a stroke and be incapacitated or have dementia. There's a lot of things, or have, you know, be on chemotherapy. There's lots of things worse than death. Yeah, I mean, if you look at processed meat, it's linked to a lot of chronic diseases, not just death. So the CNN one just talked about death, but if we look at processed meats, it's been associated with higher blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, bowel and stomach cancers. You know, granted, they're all observational in nature, but that's unfortunately what we have. It's hard to do a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in regards to processed meat because we live so long. So we have to look at observational studies. So, you know, bottom line is, you know, eating high amounts of processed meats or, you know, even red meats, the one, you know, that are not free-range over a long period of time may increase the risk of many chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Alan, again, thank you for our great podcast, fantastic information. If you like our evidence-based medicine approach where we have two documented peer-reviewed articles before we discuss it on our channels, please subscribe to our channel. Please tell your friends about our podcast. Our next podcast is going to be about things you can do, little tricks you can do in your normal life to reduce your chances of developing dementia. All right, Alan, looking forward to our next talk together. Thank you.
