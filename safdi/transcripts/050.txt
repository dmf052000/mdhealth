Covid-19: How to travel and stay safe!
Episode: 050

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in what we think is the best podcast today on evidence-based medicine. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine specialist. Both Dr. Safdie and I have been engaged in peer-reviewed clinical research for more than 30 years, and we only want to put out evidence-based medicine for people to understand. Today, Alan, I want to talk about COVID-19 and travel. They're reducing the restrictions on travel in the United States. Give me some guidelines for traveling. My wife and I are driving out to Phoenix to see our grandkids, and I'm worried about, first of all, are there going to be restrooms? Where do we stop? Is it safe to get carryout food? And is it safe to stay in hotels right now? Yeah, that's a great question, Bill. And before people travel, I want them to take a look and see if they are one of the ones with risk factors for severe COVID-19. And that would change my recommendations. So if you're one of the people with heart disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, respiratory illness, obesity, hypertension, immunosuppressed, and there's about 22% of the world's population that I would put in the high-risk group. So it may change whether you really think you should travel. So the first thing is, before you head out, make sure you're willing and able to protect yourself. Considerations for travel are good. Are you going to be going by air? Are you going to be going by bus or train? So air travel, let's approach that first. Air travel, one of the things that worries me is you're going to be spending time in security lines. And both you and I have been in lines at a farmer's market. They even have dots on the ground that are six feet apart at the farmer's market, and people can't seem to understand what six feet is. Same thing in security lines at airports and airport terminals. So you're going to be in much closer contact with people indoors. You're going to be coming in contact with frequently touched surfaces. And that doesn't take into consideration on flights how the air circulates. But on the airplane, maybe it does not spread as easily on flights because the filtration system on airplanes. But the social distancing is difficult on crowded flights or even waiting in line to get on and off airplanes and baggage and other things. Car travel, as you mentioned, you've got multiple stops along the way. You've got gas. You've got food. You've got bathroom breaks. You're coming in contact with other people. You're coming in contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. So anticipate your traveling. So I know you're going on a long car ride, Bill, and I don't envy you. But make sure you have enough alcohol-based hand sanitizer, at least 60% alcohol. Keep it within easy reach, one in your car, one in your pocket. Bring something that you can cover your face, buy some disposable face masks or get some face masks. Ideally, I would prepare food and water for your trip, pack food in case restaurants and stores are closed. If you're going in and getting carryout, take it out of the box. The box is what's typically going to be contaminated. Oral ingestion of COVID is not a significant risk factor, but it's touching a contaminated package and then touching your nose or rubbing your nose, your eyes. There's these ACE2 receptors in your eyes. That's why when we're talking about a mask, when I walk, I also have on sunglasses because if somebody coughs into your eyes, those same receptors are in your respiratory tract or actually in your eyes too. If you're going into your hotel, try to stay six feet away. Sometimes you can go in and you can go ahead and register without ever going up to the desk. And I clean my room. So I don't, you know, I clean all the surfaces that I'm going to touch. I'm not worried about sheets and pillows and things like that, but a TV remote, the door handles in the bathroom, you know, the counter where I'm going to put down things, the handles for turning on the hot and cold water. So those are all really important. They only take me several minutes and I've done it well before COVID. Do you put anything in the toilet? Do you put Lysol or any of those kind of Clorox or any of those type of products in the toilet? You know, that's a great question because as you're alluding to, when you flush the toilet, you know, there's COVID-19 in stool. So when people flush the toilet, you're aerosolizing what's in the toilet if you don't put down the toilet seat. So ideally when you're in there before you flush, the toilet seat is down. That's one of the things that bothers me in rest areas. There's some rest areas that there's so many people and they're so crowded, in all honesty, I go behind the rest area into the woods and use that as my restroom because I can't stay six feet away from people. And toilets and rest areas don't have lids on them. And people are flushing those constantly and they're aerosolizing that. In the hotel, no. I wipe down everything around there. I make sure the lid is closed when it's flushed. And I'm not that worried really about that. I'm really worried about, you know, indoors, the buffet. Would I go to a buffet? Absolutely not. Am I going to sit next to people? I might get some food and take it outdoors. But remember this, we can decrease the risk tremendously by, you know, the social distancing. And remember that the summer health hazards during COVID-19 are not just related to COVID-19. You know, we're hiking more. So we're exposed to more ticks. So the insect population, we're exposed to them. You know, people get anaphylaxis from bees. Don't forget that. People are going to beaches. Don't forget about sunburn. But, you know, be careful in the hotels. Be careful in restaurants. Will I eat in a restaurant right now, even with six-foot distancing? I don't know the ventilation system in the restaurant. I am not going indoors to eat in a restaurant. I get carryout when I'm traveling, and I'll eat outside. Would you eat in an outdoor restaurant? So far, I have not. I've gotten carryout. But if the spacing was adequate, after I touch a utensil, sit down, I'm going to put alcohol on my hands before I start eating. But I don't think there's any great risk if the spacing is adequate being outdoors. I think our risk is indoors. And right when the restaurants opened up near us, I saw six-foot spacing between tables. Now I don't see that. I see two to three feet, sometimes less than three feet. And bars, I've been very disturbed because of the bars. People get a drink or two in them, and they just totally forget social distancing. And there's essentially no social distancing. And people, that's just not going to work. The disease is around. It's here to stay for a while. And as we've mentioned, even if there's a successful vaccine, which we're praying that there is, by this midwinter, it's going to take at least two years to get the population vaccinated enough to eliminate the disease. And we already have a group of anti-vaxxers who are putting out statements why not to get a vaccine. So this disease is going to be around at least for a couple years. So please follow the social distancing guidelines. Do you have any comments on that, Alan? No, I agree with you completely. I mean, we have to realize, and I've worked on vaccine research for some time, and some vaccines we don't even have effective vaccines for. So hepatitis C, we have a treatment, but we don't have a vaccine yet. You know, HIV, we do not have a vaccine for. Other vaccines we have, like influenza, we have it, but it's not all that efficacious. I would get it every year, but some years it's 30% to 40% efficacious, some years more, some years less, depending upon the best guess. And how durable the antibodies are going to be is questionable. And then older people often don't develop the great number of antibodies that are needed. So young people may develop more antibodies. So we need to get herd immunity. We really need everybody to get vaccinated when we have this. And I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up being a yearly vaccine in order to maintain adequate neutralizing antibodies. So as we get a yearly flu vaccine, it may not be like a measles vaccine. Once you got measles, you're essentially immune for life. I'm not sure that it's going to be like that. But again, this is novel. So a lot of the things we say we're guessing. But when you're traveling, just remember, continue to abide by the distancing, the wash, mask, distance, you know, WMD. Keep your mask with you. I alternate my mask, especially if I'm in a contaminated environment. I don't want to put the same mask on. And learn how to put your mask on effectively without touching the front of it and contaminating your hands. If you do, you know, alcohol your hands at that time. So be careful of exposure. Be careful of aerosolized environments where people are talking loudly, yelling, screaming. You probably won't see me in an indoor restaurant for some time or a football game or a sporting event for some time if people are in close proximity. Thank you, Alan. That's a great discussion.
