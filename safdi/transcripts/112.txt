Non-sugar sweeteners: What the WHO had to say...not so sweet
Episode: 112

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me on this evidence-based medicine podcast. First, I want to apologize. Dr. Safdie, who's the chief medical officer at Quadrant Health for Stanford University, has been swamped with work. We've both been very swamped, but we both are now committed to turning our attention back to doing some evidence-based podcasts. So please stay tuned. We have an exciting topic today. The WHO has put a statement out on non-sugar sweeteners, and I think it's a very important topic. And I want to hear what Dr. Safdie, one of the world's experts on nutrition and gastroenterology, has to say of that. Dr. Safdie, are you there? Yeah. Hi, Bill. And again, I want to echo your sentiments. We really apologize. We've not had the podcast that we wanted to have over this period of time. It's just been very busy the last six months. Well, listen, let's go ahead. We're very excited about going through some new information. In regards to the World Health Organization, non-sugar sweeteners have been around for a while. They're not new. Why do we have non-sugar sweeteners? Because we know that consuming over six teaspoons of added sugar a day is linked to a whole bunch of diseases. And that's added sugar, not sugar in your apple or your orange, if you eat a whole orange or apple, but added sugars. And we know they're linked to stroke, depression, cardiovascular disease. And there's a whole host of problems with added sugars. As you know, I don't have basically no added sugars in my diet. And we all need to work to keep the amount of added sugars to six teaspoons a day or less and only consume, at the most, one or fewer sugar-sweetened beverages, not a day, a week. So daily sugar, it's a broad term for a bunch of carbohydrates. We include glucose, fructose, lactose, all those things. But a lot of them are added. I mean, you can buy a yogurt that's very healthy or you can buy one that has a fair amount of added sugars. You have to look at labels to see how much added sugar is in there. It doesn't just come in soft drinks. You can have a Greek yogurt. It can have a fair amount of added sugar. We all need glucose. Yeah, I mean, just ketchup has added sugar in it. And I'd like to make a statement about that too, is fructose. Now, fructose, I think all of us should consider fructose a poison. Fructose is only allowed in food, as I understand it, in the United States. Other countries do not allow fructose in food. So always check the label for fructose. Fructose is difficult to clear from the liver and is one of the main causes for fatty liver disease in the United States, which is now the most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States. But Alan, go on with your talk about sugars. That's fascinating. Yeah, I mean, fructose, you know, you're talking about these concentrated fructose forms. And the only place they're metabolized is one place in your body, not in your brain, not in your muscles, no place that it needs sugar. They're metabolized in your liver. Whereas glucose is the primary source of fuel for our bodies. It helps our brain. It helps our central nervous system. It helps our muscles. But we don't need to incorporate added sugars such as sucrose or glucose into our diets because many foods can convert to those. Proteins, carbohydrates, vegetables, whole grains can be naturally converted into glucose by our bodies. The real problem is when we add this added sugar, you know, this increased consumption of sugar, our risk of coronary artery disease goes up. Our risk of breast cancer goes up. Our risk of prostate cancer goes up. Our risk of pancreatic cancer, strokes, all those things, hypertension, all go up significantly by adding these sugars to our diet. So, you know, I'd like to make another comment too. Alan even talked to Congress about high fructose corn syrup, which I consider a poison. As I said, high fructose corn syrup is the only country in the world that allows high fructose corn syrup in its food. Alan went to Congress and testified in front of Congress the dangers of that drug, yet because of the corn lobby and the farmers' lobbies, nothing was done. So just keep that in mind. That's just a poison. One of the things you need to check on labels. Go ahead, Alan. You're absolutely right. I mean, and we all have to be personally responsible for our health. You know, so what happened in regards to, you know, sugars? So we ended up with a variety of, you know, sugar substitutes or non-sugar sweeteners, predominantly for weight control in the United States. Have they worked? Look around the world and see if they've worked. They have not worked. So the World Health Organization came out with, in early June this year, came out with another recommendation, which is, I think, a very reasonable one. And their guideline is on non-sugar sweeteners is don't use them to control weight or reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. And they didn't include just one of them. They include things that a lot of you will think are natural, stevia, stevia derivatives, aspartame, you know, saccharin, sucralose. And the review that they did is based upon 283 studies, not a few studies, but 283 studies. And they found some significant dangers of those. And we'll discuss some of those studies in a bit. But, you know, it's suggested that like for saccharin, increased risk of bladder cancer. Is it certainly there? No, but there's a tendency to think that may be a problem. So should we reduce sugar content in our diet? Yes. Should we substitute that with sugar substitutes? No. And one of the problems is if, Bill, you've heard of erythritol. It's a sugar alcohol. And, you know, sugar alcohols do not have to be listed as an added sugar onto a label. So you may not even know. So you have to look and actually read the label. Artificial sweeteners have become so widespread that it's a significant danger. And you're looking for ways to reduce those. So erythritol is a really common artificial sweetener. And low amounts occur naturally. So you can get some in fruits. You can get some in vegetables. It's also made inside our cells as part of normal metabolism. But when used as a sweetener, it's a thousandfold greater in sweetness than or greater than you would find levels in natural food. So it's a sugar alcohol and does not have to be listed individually on the nutrition facts label, which is really a problem. And we found that, you know, elevated levels of erythritol, as well as other artificial sweeteners, were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. And a recent study of looking at 3,000 people, and they used a better method to distinguish erythritol than other compounds. And they found that there's some significant risks. If even something that is obscure as blood clot formation, that erythritol can increase the risk of blood clot formation. That may increase the risk of heart attack. So erythritol is prevalent as an artificial sweetener in our food. And because of the cardiovascular risk, probably, in my opinion, we should be avoiding that. You know, another study recently, sucralose, very common compound that we've seen as a sugar substitute. And recent researchers early this month, I think it was early June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, somewhere around there, that's sold under the brand name Splenda. And they recommended in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health that we really stop consuming sucralose because sucralose causes DNA to break apart, putting people at risk for disease. They link sucralose to what we call leaky gut syndrome, which means it's not really leaky gut, but it means the lining of your intestines, you know, the surface lining become more permeable so things can get through there. So it can cause some of these things of gas, bloating, diarrhea. So, you know, is this DNA toxic or genotoxic potentially? And it's something that, in my opinion, we really should avoid and in their opinion also. You know, so we've got erythritol. What about the oldest one, aspartame? Aspartame has been around forever. And aspartame was first approved in 1981. Then again in 1983, FDA looked at it in 1996. They looked at it multiple times. And the FDA concluded that aspartame was safe for the general population under certain conditions unless you had phenylketonuria. However, a recent Japanese study reviewed the literature to determine if certain artificial sweeteners are beneficial for patients with diabetes. And they looked at this one as well as sucralose and saccharin and all the other ones. And, you know, other than a few advantages, one reducing calories, it's a non-chloric flavor-enhancing promoter, the disadvantages were much more significant, including increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, disordered HDL, your protective form of cholesterol, increased cancer risk, increased cardiovascular risk. So, you know, we've got a whole host of these artificial sweeteners that we really need to rethink should we be using these artificial sweeteners. You know, that may have an increased risk of heart attack, strokes, cancer, or death. So think about it when you're getting something. What do I drink? I drink smoothies where it's a whole orange or whole apple and I put them in, but predominantly I drink water. I like sparkling water,
