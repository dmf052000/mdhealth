How important is sleep?
Episode: 115

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Dr. William Renner, and it's my pleasure to host this series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. I'm the Emeritus Director of Radiology at the Ohio GI and Liver Institute. Dr. Alan Safdie is Chief Medical Officer of Quadrant Health, owned by Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Safdie served as Chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Gastroenterology at the Deaconess Hospital and Ohio GI Liver Institute, and has been elected President of the Ohio Gastroenterology Society. Dr. Safdie has been the primary investigator in more than 200 medical studies and co-investigator in more than 800 studies. Today we're going to talk about sleep and sleep and exercise. First, Alan, let me ask you, what are the stages of sleep? That's a good question, Bill. We all sleep. For many years, you and I slept too little, being on call every third night. And actually back then, I did not realize, until we started researching some of this, how important sleep was. So the difference is, first we have light sleep, which we call stages 1 and 2. Those are around 50 to 60 percent of your total sleep time. It's kind of the transition stage. When you're awake and you're transitioning to sleep, you're kind of awake, kind of asleep. That lasts a few minutes, stage 2 being a little bit deeper. The stage that's really, really important, imagine the garbage collector going through your brain and taking out all these proteins we don't want sitting there and all the trash that built up during the day. And that's the deep sleep that we get. Unfortunately, that's not a majority of time in our sleep. That's about 15 to 20 percent of our sleep time. Is deep sleep the same as REM sleep? No. No, good question. REM sleep, if any of you have a dog, when my dog has REM sleep, it wakes me up. REM means rapid eye movement. And that's when your eyes may be moving, if you watch a dog or some humans. It's the most active part of our sleep. It's the one that we're processing memories and emotions and other parts of our sleep. But that supports learning and creativity and problem solving during, I'm not sure what problems my dog is solving during her REM sleep. But the deep sleep, which is the most restorative, when somebody has some element of dementia, that's one of the first things we're looking at is how much are they sleeping? Do they get into deep sleep? Some of these devices that you wear may give you a hint, but they're not that accurate. The watches, what about the Apple Watch? Is that accurate or does that help us? I have one. I have an Oura Ring. When I wear it, I don't normally sleep very well. And then I get very paranoid because it says I wasn't in deep sleep for the amount of time I want to be in deep sleep. Yes, they give you some idea. They're not as accurate. Deep sleep is very difficult. They usually underestimate the amount of deep sleep. So a lot of our patients get very upset that it doesn't say they're in deep sleep as much as they would like. And it tends to underestimate it compared to what we find in a sleep lab. But they do help. It depends on how neurotic you are. They're not great for me. But for some people, they are. What can we do to help our sleep? Well, you know, so there's recent research that was done at University College London and found that exercise and deep sleep improves significant sleep function. How can you sleep better? Again, exercise during the day, avoiding caffeine afternoon, getting out in sunlight during the day, trying to go to bed at the same time every day, wake up around the same time, have established patterns, and absolutely, and we'll talk about this in a future podcast, get rid of any external light sources within your bedroom. Any more than one lumen, like a very dim candle in the bedroom. I know you also mentioned to me that vigorous exercise was linked to improved memory the next day. Yeah, not just any kind of work. Your working memory as well as your episodic memory the next day. Reducing sedentary behavior and more sleep, at least six hours, including REM sleep and deep sleep, were associated with better memory and better attention. Before I ever lecture, I always exercise. There's chemicals released in your brain called, one of them being brain-derived neurotrophic factor. When you exercise, you will find you can remember better, your attention is better. They followed 76 individuals, and it was a well-done study, and older, between 50 and 83, and they wore accelerometers to track their physical activity. And they found a significant correlation with exercise and improvement in this episodic memory, improved attention. Same as deep sleep. When they had more deep sleep, they had improved memory function. So you're saying, as I'm picking it up, stay away from caffeine, especially afternoon time. Exercise vigorously, if you can, at least for a few minutes. Did you say don't eat before you go to bed? Was that one of the things you mentioned? Well, you know, for a lot of reasons, I recommend that people have about a 12-hour fast per day. That being one of the ones for gastroesophageal reflux. You don't want to eat for two to three hours before going to bed. You don't want to wake up and you don't want to have a snack before going to bed because you have to metabolize that snack. And remember, when you do exercise, it's going to improve blood flow to your brain. It's going to improve oxygen supply. It's going to give you these neurotransmitters. It's going to improve this neuroplasticity in your brain. It's going to improve your memory and learning. And getting this deep sleep is really important. But one of the problems that we see all the time is a phone in the bedroom, a computer in the bedroom, a television in the bedroom, lots of lights. So, you know, if we have a nightlight in the bedroom, we have it at very soft that goes on by an electric eye and it goes back off immediately. Yeah, we were saying during the Christmas holidays, lots of people around here put up lights, Christmas lights, and we put on some blackout screens in our rooms and blackout curtains. And they were relatively very inexpensive at Amazon, very easy to put up. And our bedroom now is perfectly dark. It makes it so much easier for me to sleep. Yeah, just remember that this deep sleep, this exercise patterns have a lot more to do with your health and your wellness. So we're talking about health span, not lifespan, keeping you healthy for as many years as possible. So really think about that. Think about what you're doing during the day. You know, think about what you're eating. We talked about foods, inflammatory foods and other things on previous podcasts. So if you haven't listened to those, please go back and listen to those. I want to have one more question. What about naps? A lot of older people ask me about should they take naps or not? I don't think it's just old people. I mean, it's a pretty common question. And the question is, why are you napping, Bill? You know, is it inappropriate? Do you have excessive daytime sleepiness? So it's one of the questions I asked. Do you have any underlying issues such as depression or other medical conditions? You know, tips for keeping it healthy. Unfortunately, I don't nap. I don't really get that tired. But, you know, short naps. If you're going to take a nap, 10 to 30 minutes can improve focus, can improve reaction time, actually, it's been studied, and productivity. Can it boost memory? Yes. I mean, there's some studies that say naps can help you consolidate memories and improve, you know, memory retention. And some people, it lowers their stress levels. And me, it might increase my stress level. You know, and it may get rid of some irritability in certain people. But, you know. I'm wondering if you might need a nap. Yeah. It's a possibility. I mean, I just never really had the desire to take a nap, and I don't really get tired. But it does, in some people, which it probably wouldn't be, would disrupt my nighttime sleep. So you have to look at it. If you're napping and you take long naps or late naps, can it interfere with your ability to fall asleep that night, Bill? So there's a lot of questions I ask people. You know, does it prevent you from staying asleep at night? You know, so if you took a 25-minute nap, I would ask you, are you sleeping just as well at night? You know, do you have insomnia at night when you're doing this? We look for underlying health conditions. Most people don't have any. And a lot of people, they just get tired. And I tell people, try to keep it relatively short, under 30 minutes, ideally 10 to 20 minutes. Set an alarm. And nap before about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. You know, don't take a nap later in the day. All right, Alan, sounds like great advice. Thank you. Thanks, Bill.
