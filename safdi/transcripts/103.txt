Why diet and exercise don‘t work!
Episode: 103

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining us on this evidence-based podcast. Today, I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and expert in nutrition. We're going to talk about diet and exercise and why it doesn't work to prolong longevity. Alan, tell us about this. Well, it's a pretty provocative topic. You know, we spend a fortune on exercise in this country, but we spend a fortune on health care. Currently, health care costs our country about $2 trillion a year. What we need to do is take a lot of that wasted money we spend on health care and try to shift it to optimizing our environment. And what I mean by optimizing our environment, and I've traveled the world and gone to a variety of countries, and a lot of them have as long or longer longevity than we do, and they don't have gyms. But they spend money on things like widening sidewalks. We want to plant trees. We want to clean up graffiti. We want safe places for people to walk. We want public transportation. We want physical activity as a whole to be part of our life and lifestyle, not going to the gym for 20 or 30 minutes. We don't want people to go to the gym and work out for 30 minutes and then go have a fancy coffee that has more calories than they just consumed at the gym. It has to be an integral part of our lifestyle. We've made fitness an industry, but we haven't made people healthier. Tell us about one of those, but where's one of the places where people live longer but really actually have less money and less things that actual things they do instead of incorporating into their life? Yeah, I mean, if you go to Sardinia, I mean, they walk to the grocery store. They walk back, and there's some pretty significant hefty hills there. They go out for walks all the time. They don't consider that exercise. They go out and they do gardening. If you go to – I spent time in Cuba as a medical ambassador under a couple administrations ago, but the people in Cuba, they have beautiful walking and biking and hiking trails there in every city. And it's – I would go out for a run and people would join me. They'd have to slow down quite a bit because I'm really slow nowadays. But it's part of their lifestyle. Costa Rica, the Seventh-day Adventists in this country, we're spending a lot on our health care. $2 trillion is a lot of money to be spending on health care without incorporating healthy dietary choices, not a diet, healthy dietary choices that don't end. You want a walkable community, and that's what all these places that – when you look at the National Geographic studies for places that live longer, they're walkable communities. I want people to walk to the grocery store. I want them to be able to walk back to dinner even if it's a ways away. So we need this. And exercise, we can talk about some of the benefits of exercise, and there's tremendous benefits of exercise that we need to talk about that we forget. I mean we forget all these benefits. What do you think is better, Bill, endurance exercise or resistance exercise? I would say endurance myself. Right. Because that's the things you can do for a long time. Endurance exercise such as biking or running or walking appears in some studies, and there was a study that was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology that that endurance-type exercise was more beneficial to human health than resistance exercise. I'm not saying you shouldn't do resistance exercise. There's four types of exercise everybody should be doing all the time. But these little mitochondria, which are – imagine them the engines or the powerhouse of our cells, increased mitochondrial activity occurs when these sustained long periods of exercise. Good metabolic health translates into a lot of things, not just a couple things. One, you get released, and we can talk about it in a minute, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, improved blood sugar control, improved cholesterol, improved waist circumference. We don't want to just weigh people. We want to see what their waist circumference is. And then poor metabolic health by eating a lousy diet, by not getting this kind of endurance-type exercise, you have an increased risk of heart disease, increased risk of diabetes and strokes. So we want to focus on these things. Exercise, there's previous studies, exercise can make you 10 years younger. You won't look 10 years younger, but physiologically younger. And there's studies to show the faster that you walked, the longer you may live. So walking for as little as two hours per week brings down the risk of all-cause mortality, and it was significant. And older people may reap stronger benefits. People say I'm too old to start. In a previous study, participants age 60 or over had a 46% lower risk of death related to cardiovascular disease if they walked at an average pace for two hours per week, and even better if they walked a little bit faster. So we need to be working on these things, and we'll do this in a couple, you know, the podcast on this will be in a couple sections because this is very long, and I want people to understand this. But exercise has so many numerous health benefits, and there's a graded relationship between exercise and the development of chronic conditions. And I don't want people to think of exercise at the gym. 30 minutes at the gym isn't going to undo an unhealthy lifestyle. That's why I say diet and exercise don't work. Lifestyle does. We want to prevent diabetes. We want to prevent chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, some cancers. And, you know, when I was mentioning before, there was a study that people in advanced age who exercise regularly around 10 years younger in terms of motor skills. So not looking younger, but their motor skills were much better than those who had led a sedentary lifestyle. So we really need to be focusing on a lot of these things as exercise a potential therapy to treat cancers and prevent cancers. And we'll talk in the next one about how it improves brain function. So as we get older, we want to think about how can we actually improve our brain function, and it's not just going to the gym for a few minutes. All right, Alan, that's a great start. Yeah.
