How much protein do you need in your diet? Too much may be harmful!
Episode: 083

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts focused on evidence-based wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is board certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology and a fellow of the American College of Gastroenterology. He has lectured around the world and was principal investigator in about 300 clinical studies and co-investigator in about 900 clinical studies. Dr. Safdie and I continue to be actively involved in medical research. Today, I want to talk about protein. Alan, how much protein do you need and is there any risk to taking too much protein? Bill, that's a good question because everybody in this day and age is talking about high-protein diets. Let's step back for a second and say, what populations live the longest in the world? The area of the blue zones, whether it be a Mediterranean diet, the Sardinians, whether it be Seventh-day Adventists, vegetarians, whether it be the Okinawans, the Costa Ricans, these populations live a long time. Some of them have very common characteristics in that they take the Mediterranean diet, for instance. At the base of their pyramid is fruits, vegetables, whole grains, not processed grains, olive oil, beans, nuts, legumes, seeds, herbs, and spices. That's the base. Then you add a little bit of fish and seafood. At the very top are meats and sweets in their diet. We know that the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease, reduced risk of death from cancer, reduced incidence of Parkinson's, reduced risk of dementia via Alzheimer's disease. We know about these things. A lot of us have to consider, how much protein do we actually need and how do we get it? There was a lecture I gave a few years back, I think about three years ago, and I titled it when I was giving it to students, Death by Bacon. Looking at that and some of the data from that, people who consumed about one serving of red meat, beef, pork, or lamb per day, had a 13% increased risk of mortality compared to those that didn't. I want you to stay tuned for the next podcast. We're going to discuss why. We finally have an answer of why. The worst part of these studies were that processed meats raised the risk higher to about 20% increased risk of deaths and diseases such as heart disease and cancer. One of the theories is the iron in the meat works as a catalyst to turn nitrates that we put into these things into a particular kind of carcinogen in the body. Grilling the meat may even make it worse, but these highly processed foods make it worse. We understand that high-protein diet in middle age may increase risk for diabetes, cancer, mortality, but we were perplexed to why. High-protein diet defined as an intake diet derived at least 20% of their calories from protein. That's a lot of calories from protein, but nowadays we see a lot of people consuming more than 20% of their calories from protein. Moderate amounts would be 10% to 19%, and then a low-protein diet would be less than 10% in those patients. We see people taking more and more protein. Bill, how much protein do you think you should really take in? Oh, in grams a day, I would say 120 grams. That's a lot of protein. That's a lot of protein. Unless you've got a lot bigger since the last time I saw you, and I doubt you take in that much. Let's talk about it a little bit. All of us need protein. Athletes consume it, they think, for recovery, bodybuilders, down to bulk up. All diets have a minimum protein requirement. It isn't necessary to take in excessive amounts. Protein is a large molecule. It plays a lot of critical roles virtually everywhere. People don't even know what the roles it plays is, but it plays roles in muscles, which we understand, but bones, skin, hair, inner organs itself, and body tissues. It may help in regards to repairing cells and body tissue. It plays a vital role in this, and it helps in production of hormones and antibodies and enzymes. When you eat protein, your digestive system breaks down the protein into amino acids. Some people think, well, I'm going to consume collagen. It's going to be absorbed as collagen. No, when we eat proteins, it's broken down into amino acids. Those amino acids are transported around the body to build muscle and use for some of the other functions I mentioned above. Most of the time, Bill, you can synthesize the amino acids you need in your own body, but there's nine essential amino acids that the body can't make on its own. I'm not going to bore you and test you on all nine of those, but name me just one. Lysine. You got it. Histidine, lysine, methionine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan are just some of those. The food sources we think of are meat, poultry, fish, eggs. Those are common sources that we think of. There's a lot of plant-based sources that you can get. The general protein requirements, the Institute of Medicine, who we look to a lot of times to help create these recommended daily allowance of protein, is 0.8 grams for every kilogram of body weight. Say you're 100 kilograms, which you're not, but that'll make it easy. That would be 80 grams of protein. Divide your weight in kilograms. Either you can use your iPhone or your smartphone to figure it out, or you can divide your weight by 2.2, and that'll give you the number of kilograms. Like a 130-pound woman would aim for about 47 grams of protein per day. A 150-pound man might be 54 grams of protein a day. These are what we look at as a recommended daily allowance. If you consume up to twice the RDA of protein, this may be safe depending upon how you get this protein. As you get older, you may need higher amounts of protein because you start to have muscle wasting. The elderly may need more protein than what we typically recommend. After age 30, people start to lose some of their muscle mass. That can be prevented in a lot of respects. In a lot of these podcasts we've given, and we want people to preserve this muscle mass, but every decade they may lose 3% of their muscle mass, which is kind of scary. Look at healthy individuals over 65. We look at 1 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That's why I said that would be an excessive amount of protein for you if you're consuming that much. I think the American diet has a lot of protein in it sometimes. How much is a Big Mac? I think that's the most common thing that teenagers eat at McDonald's, isn't it? Yeah, and what happens is that protein controls this insulin-like growth factor. Those levels dramatically decrease after age 65. Increasing the amount of protein, you may increase that insulin-like growth factor in patients. Some of these things have risk. Those who consume the most protein were four times more likely to die of cancer, especially if it was animal-based proteins, not from plant-based proteins. We didn't know the answers to this, and I really want people to think back on the next podcast, and I want to give you what I think is some fascinating research we have into why. All right, let's stay tuned then for the next podcast. I'm really excited to hear about this. I guess the question is, what is the surprisingly smelly reason why eating less meat is related to healthier aging? That'll be discussed in our next podcast. That's great. Stay tuned for that because it is fascinating. We understand that it's very important to get appropriate protein, but maybe we should be changing how we get some of our protein intake.
