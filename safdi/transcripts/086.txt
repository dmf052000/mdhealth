Covid-19 Vaccine Myths Corrected
Episode: 086

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine and wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie has lectured around the world and is the principal investigator in about 300 clinical research studies and the co-investigator in about 900 clinical research studies. Alan, today I want to talk about COVID-19 vaccine myths, okay? Because I know there's a lot of hesitancy to take that vaccine. You and I, just to explain to the audience, and I think if people listen, they all know, you and I have both taken the vaccine. I've had both doses of the Moderna vaccine and had very little reaction and no apparent problem with it. But let's talk about some of the myths. Here's one I get from the nurses all the time. They developed the vaccine so fast it can't be safe. It's a great question, Bill. I get it all the time. I not only get it in person, but by multiple emails every evening. And it's true. There's no question that this vaccine was developed extremely fast. You know, the previous record breaker in regards to rapidity of vaccine development, other than the influenza vaccines, because we modify those on a yearly basis, was the mumps vaccine, which was developed in about four years. But this wasn't from scratch. That's one of the things people don't understand. We've been studying coronaviruses, which COVID-19 is, for many decades now. It's not new. You know, COVID-19 is on every single continent on this planet right now. You know, right now we have 102 million infections, more than 2.2 million deaths. You know, we have this spread throughout the world. So we have unprecedented worldwide collaboration. Usually we have difficulty enrolling people. I've been involved in clinical research for over 30 years. So it's very difficult for me sometime to recruit volunteers. And this time with COVID-19, there was absolutely more volunteers than you could almost use. Some of these studies were huge. The Johnson & Johnson study is a gigantic study. You know, over 40,000 individuals that are enrolled in that study. So normally... That's huge. Yeah, normally what, there's 2,000, 3,000 in a study? I mean, you know, the AstraZeneca, I'll have to look at the exact ones because I wasn't involved, maybe 20,000 something people. Multiple studies going on at one time. As we mentioned before, you know, phase three studies is up in the 70s. So multiple studies enrolling at the same time with no shortage of people in most of these studies. So it wasn't fast. And some of this has been in development. Messenger RNA has been in development for some time. So it's kind of sitting, waiting on the shelf to be developed. So we have huge numbers in the studies. We've had huge numbers that have already been vaccinated. So as you said, you've gotten the vaccine because you understand the safety profile. And I understand this vaccine. The vaccine is only making for a short period of time spike proteins. It's not making anything else. And the vaccine gets into our muscle cells, a little bit into our spleen, a little bit into our liver, and a little bit into the lymph nodes, but predominantly in the muscle cells where it's injected and into the cytoplasm. And you make these spike proteins, not for very long. You know, it'd be nice if it made them a little bit longer because that messenger RNA is pushed out of those cells as the cells need to go on to other functions. And that's it. It's not doing anything else. So although it was developed with rapidity, I am at this point in time happy with the safety profile. All right, here's a question. Can the vaccine or does the vaccine alter my DNA? Yeah, maybe it can alter mine and make me taller and younger. No, it doesn't alter your DNA. You know, these are based upon messenger RNA. These vaccines work differently to traditional types of vaccines. You know, the classic vaccines you get, we either chop up viruses into little pieces or inactivate them and give them to people to produce an immune response. This is giving you instructions into your cells, as I mentioned previously, but it doesn't get into the nucleus of the cell. The instructions go into the cytoplasm, the stuff around the nucleus, and it only makes these proteins, you know, for a short period of time, kind of priming the response to your immune system. So your immune system can respond to COVID-19 if it comes in contact with it. But it does not hang around inside these cells for any prolonged period of time. It's not integrated in any fashion into your DNA. It doesn't even get into the nucleus where your DNA resides. All right. Is the vaccine made with fetal tissue? You know, there is absolutely no evidence that the vaccine is made with fetal tissue. There's no fetal components within the vaccine whatsoever. You know, the vaccine itself, and this is a, you know, rumor that's been spread around, neither of the COVID-19 vaccines that we have approved in this country at this time have any tissue from fetuses, none whatsoever. And as I understand it, my wife is Catholic, that the Pope has endorsed this vaccine. So saying that there's no fetal tissue used in this vaccine. There's none within the vaccines, whether people, you know, there's fetal cell lines that are out, fetus cell lines that are out there, have nothing to do with the vaccine. But sometimes they use these from the early 1970s and 1980s to look for toxicity against these things. But there is absolutely, in the vaccines that will be administered in people, there is absolutely no fetal tissue in any of these vaccines. And fetal tissue was not used to make these vaccines. No, there's no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process. All right. Now, here's another big one. There's a microchip in the vaccine so the government can track you. Unfortunately, the government can already track me. Yeah, I find this hilarious. If anybody thinks they're not being tracked, you're crazy. You have a cell phone. Your location is being sent out to the entire world. I mean, if somebody wants to track me, it's not that. They're already tracking you, but it's too late for that. But even if they wanted to do this, it's not possible, especially with the size of needles and things we use, to shrink the components of a radio transmitter, a radio receiver, and a radio transponder into a small enough size to fit through the end of a needle along with the vaccine within there. It's, one, not possible. Two, it's kind of ludicrous because, as you said, if you're, in reality, our mobile phones are already, every day, tracking us. They're tracking us. Everything we do, everything we spend. I mean, if I go to a... Every dollar you buy, everything you buy, it's all being tracked. If I give a lecture in a different city, suddenly I'm getting ads from restaurants in that city, and I've never even been there before. So I'm not worried about this. And two, at this point in time, it's absolutely impossible to have transponders, receivers, transmitters, and the battery in order for those to function, then to be able to go through a needle, and two, when it doesn't have to be done. If somebody wants to track you, you're there. It's being done already. Here's another one I get. If you have comorbidities or risk factors for COVID vaccines, such as heart disease or diabetes, the vaccine might not be safe for you. Is that true? You know, that's a good question. Pre-existing conditions. Some of these people with pre-existing conditions are some of the people at highest risk for death from COVID-19. People with underlying lung disease, people with diabetes, people with obesity, people with heart disease, people that are immune response. These pre-existing conditions can increase the risk of developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms. So a lot of these patients, we feel, always talk to your doctor, but we feel being vaccinated is even more important for them with these pre-existing conditions than it is for the general population. If people had a history of severe allergic reactions, however, to vaccines or injectable medications, you know, they should always talk to their doctors and people with history of allergies to oral medications or family history of severe allergic reactions. You know, we do vaccinate, but we always say, tell the people that you're doing your vaccination. Alan, here's another question. If you have pre-existing health conditions like severe heart disease or diabetes or obesity, is the vaccine safe for you to get? You know, that's a good question, Bill, because people, you know, we've heard people saying, you know, I can't take this vaccine because I have diabetes or obesity or, you know, one of these pre-existing conditions, lung disease. You know, always talk to your doctor to discuss it. But, you know, the people that are greatest risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and complications are the ones with obesity, are the ones with heart disease, diabetes, lung disease. These people are at significant risk. So, you know, we do recommend vaccinating people with pre-existing conditions, but talk to your physicians first. You know, the one caveat would be the people with a history of severe allergic reactions, you know, always talk to your doctors about that if you've had severe allergic reactions. You know, if people had a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of severe allergic reactions, you know, we are going ahead and vaccinating those patients. But again, discuss that with your family physician and make sure no matter who you are that the site you're going to can treat allergic reactions, meaning they mainly
