Best plant based protein sources
Episode: 082

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this evidence-based medicine podcast. I'm here today with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine physician. Dr. Safdie, we've been talking about the Mediterranean diet. What are some good protein sources from plant-based sources? How can we get protein from plants? You know, Bill, that's a question that people ask me all the time because a lot of the healthiest diets that we have around the world are predominantly plant-based. You know, if we look at the blue zones, almost every single one of those sites where people live the longest, they have either a plant-based diet or predominantly plant-based diet. So there's lots of ways of adding this. As you know, I've been a vegetarian for 30-something years, have no intention of not being a vegetarian, but some of these, and these are more vegan-based, I'm going to give you initially that you can have oats. First of all, as I told you, I have oats, steel-cut oats every single morning with seeds. So I might have, you know, chia seeds, which have protein, pumpkin seeds in there, flax. I put in there along with my oats that have protein also. One of the things people don't understand is gluten is a protein. But, you know, other means of getting this, I have lots of beans, things like lentils. If people don't like tofu, which is a great source, they can have seitan. It's S-E-I-T-A-N. And again, that's a wheat source-based protein. I eat lots of beans. You know, again, as I mentioned before, nuts are tremendously beneficial, almonds. Peanuts aren't necessarily a nut, but I have those every single morning before I exercise. What about peanut butter? A lot of people talk about peanut butter. Is that a good protein source? Good question, Bill. Yeah, peanuts are a great protein source depending on your peanuts. So I get mine as fresh ground peanuts, so it's just peanuts. There are a lot of healthy brands of peanut butter that you can buy, and there's some very unhealthy brands. You have to be reading labels. If there's any added sugars to this, and the sugars are hidden. You can listen to some of our previous podcasts in lots of different ways. So, you know, take a look at the labels to see what they're adding to this. But mine are basically just fresh ground peanuts. You know, you can calculate, you know, how much protein you need. As I mentioned before, you know, lentils are really beneficial, and we add those to pasta. We add them to all kinds of dishes. They also are rich in plant-based iron for those suffering from iron deficiency. Tofu is made from fermented soybeans, can be used in multiple dishes, can be added to things, can be steamed, grilled, fried in a variety of different ways. As I said, I put seeds in. I love pumpkin seeds. You know, think about they do have a fair amount of calories, so you sprinkle them on your breakfast, either cereal or, in my case, my oatmeal. And again, oats couldn't be much of a better breakfast than you can have than oats. You know, they have 100 grams of oats contain about 14 grams of protein. So, you know, beans, lots of different ways of getting beans. It's extremely inexpensive. I bought some organic black beans, four cans yesterday. Even being organic black beans, they were 90 cents a can. I snack on those in the afternoon. I heat them up. I put them back in the microwave five times. 100 grams of beans have about 22 grams of protein. So, you know, there's a variety of different ways of adding this. Quinoa is a great way to add that. You know, it can be made as a cereal. It can be a side dish, which we often have it as a side dish. And lots of things like chickpeas, tremendously beneficial. 100 grams of chickpeas have about 19 grams of protein. So, all of these are easy ways of adding protein. One of the things we should talk about, you know, what's better? And I think I asked you before, Bill, do you think exercise is more important than protein or protein is more important for muscle function in older women? Yeah, which is more important, exercise or protein? I would say exercise. Yeah, you know, everybody has, you know, everybody thinks a high-protein diet is the most important element of this. So, there was a recent study, and they randomly incised, it just happened to be older women, into three weight loss groups for six months. You know, a high-protein diet with exercise, high-protein diet without exercise, and the typical protein diet. And all groups, interestingly, lost a similar amount of weight and body fat. The exercise groups had similar muscle strength and physical function improvements, even with different protein diets. So, if you exercise and you have a normal protein diet or if you exercise and had the high-protein diet, the high-protein diet was not beneficial in making more muscle. So, eat a healthy diet. A high-protein diet has some downsides, too. The high-protein diet with no exercise, lost strength, reduced physical function. So, one of the keys is eat a healthy diet. It doesn't matter if it's a high-protein or normal-protein diet. But when you get no exercise, you're going to lose strength, you're going to reduce physical function, you're going to lose balance, you're going to lose a lot of other things that are really important as we get older. So, you know, we know obesity negatively affects lower extremity physical function. And we always thought that a high-protein diet might be somewhat positively beneficial independent of exercise, but it's not. So, you know, get out there, exercise, look for plant-based sources of protein. I mean, there's protein in spinach. So, you know. Yes, Alan, this is another good way to continue our resolution of a happy, healthy new year is to follow these guidelines. I mean, there's just some great suggestions for all of our audience.

Thank you, and eat healthy this year, exercise reasonably, and take time for yourselves. Thank you. Thanks.
