Forget it...Dementia and how to avoid it
Episode: 060

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining what we think is the best podcast in America on evidence-based medicine. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, famous gastroenterologist, internist, who's been doing clinical research for more than 30 years, who's on the cutting edge of medicine. Alan, one of my greatest fears is dementia. Tell me about dementia, and is there a way to prevent it? Bill, that's a great question, and the good start is you remembered my name. You know, everybody when they hear the word dementia, they think of Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common type, accounting for anywhere, depending on the study, 40 to 70 percent of all caused dementia. But there's over 100 different types of dementia. Some of them are nutritional. Some of them are vascular. Some are due to hypertension. You know, there's a lot of different things. We see B12 deficiency. We've seen lots of things that can cause dementia. So don't always think of Alzheimer's disease when you're thinking of dementia. And one of the things you worry about, you know, not only Alzheimer's disease, but a lot of people worry about is really cognitive aging. As you get older, that's part of aging. Your neuron numbers remain relatively stable, but the function of these neurons may decline a little bit. And this occurs in everybody to some extent. They're gradual. You may not remember somebody's name as quickly as you used to remember their name, but you're not walking into the wrong house. You're not getting lost on the way home. You forget where your car keys are a little bit more frequently. And that's normal cognitive aging. And, you know, but dementia of all types is very common. There's more than 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease. So it should scare you. One in three seniors dies with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. When should you start worrying? When should you start worrying if you have dementia or get tested? Unfortunately, usually it's people around you that may notice before you do. So you'll start to notice the normal cognitive aging. We're very aware of, you know, being aware of forgetting somebody's name. That's normal cognitive aging. When you don't remember your kids, when you don't remember how to get home, when things are much more advanced. And you can ask your physician to do some neuropsychiatric type testing, very simple testing that we do to see if people have any signs of Alzheimer's. Eventually we're going to have a blood test or we'll have other tests that look for this at earlier stages. Because right now we have symptomatic therapy. We don't have preventative therapy other than the things we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about some preventative things. But remember, this disease kills more patients than breast and prostate cancer combined. So, you know, let's talk a little bit about, you know, how do you prevent this? And there's evidence, medically evidence-based ways to prevent, you know, cognitive decline, not just dementia. But this cognitive decline impairs the quality of our life, threatens our independence, places a tremendous burden on health care as well as the family. So look at the type of fats you're consuming. And we're just going to give you some key little things to look at right now. So eat healthy fats. Proper nutrition is very important for brain function and health and helps with cognitive function and neuroendocrine function. So we have studies with meta-analysis found that low levels of omega-3 significantly intake, significantly reduce cognitive decline. So you want a higher level, you know, the higher the level of intake of omega-3s, and it doesn't have to be by fish. It can be by flaxseed. It can be by chia seeds. There's a variety of ways. I'm a vegetarian, so I get it in other ways. Are fish oil tablets good to take? We don't know. The problem is a lot of these things cross the blood-brain barrier and not as efficient of a fashion as we would like. There was a recent study on that. So really you want a lifetime of having omega-3. So if you're going to eat fish, eat fatty fish, eat it several times per week. If you want to take flaxseed oil tablets. So fatty fish you're talking about? Salmon. Salmon. But not farm-raised because farm-raised doesn't have the reasonable good omega-3s. Wild salmon, like wild coho salmon. There's other fatty fish out there. I am not an expert in fish. I probably haven't had any in 35 years. You know, solve puzzles. Activities that stimulate cognition are important. You know, cultivate strong relationships, whether it be with a significant other. But we have meta-analysis that showed, you know, researchers compared dementia risk in married people with those who are single, widowed, or divorced. And they found lifelong single people had 42% increased risk of developing dementia, widowed people 20%. And that was the comparator group was the married people. So it doesn't necessarily mean you have to be married, but, you know, looking at strong relationships and the communication that goes along with those. And exercise. Physical activity definitely helps prevent cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. You know, conversely, sedentary people, it heightens the risk of age-associated cognitive decline. And, you know, experts, there was a previous study, estimated that 25% reduction in sedentary behavior could prevent more than 1 million cases of dementia disease globally. So, you know, think about that. You know, the other two things are, should you meditate? I'm not good at meditating, but I meditate when I'm walking, when I'm hiking, when I'm biking. Those Zen-type moments are beneficial for your brain and reducing stress. There's no surefire way to decrease stress. I'm not good at telling people how to do that. But realizing that, you know, look at things and say, am I going to be upset about this in 72 hours or 24 hours from now? And when you ask yourself that, when you're getting upset, if you break a glass, am I going to be upset about this tomorrow? No. Then try to forget about it. But stress-induced deficits in spatial reference, working memory, behavioral flexibility are significant. They change the synaptic and dendritic reorganization in our memory portions of our brain. So those are some key ways. And I've got a few others if we've got a minute or two, Bill. Well, I want to just comment on the blue zones. And I think a lot of people who are listening know about the blue zones and the activity and involvement that people have that seem to be one of the most important things in the blue zones. Do you want to comment on that? Yeah, I mean, I love what Dan Buettner has done with the blue zones. It's epidemiologic research. It's not evidence-based medicine per se in a controlled fashion. But he's looked at different populations and key factors in those different populations that are common, you know, in those populations are they have strong support systems. They have empowered women. So blue zones are groups of people that live longer than other groups, even nearby groups. Is that correct? Well, most of them are not in the U.S. except for, you know, we have Seventh-day Adventists that are in the United States. Most of them, yes, they may be right next door to very unhealthy populations. Seventh-day Adventists definitely are. But they're mostly plant-based. Seventh-day Adventists are completely plant-based. They usually are active, whether it be in gardening or more formal exercise or walking or biking. They have strong family relationships. They do not smoke. Most of them have relatively – if we look at blood pressure, one of the things you can do yourselves is aim to maintain your systolic blood pressure, you know, less than 130 or less in midlife, you know, starting to look at age 40. They're not exposed to air pollution or secondhand – they don't smoke. They're not exposed to secondhand smoke for the most part. None of them abuse alcohol for the most part. If they drink, they limit their drinking. And they all believe in providing their children with primary and secondary educations. And they're active. They're all involved with their children and their grandchildren. I think that's one of the most important factors is that the older people become functional and useful. They don't just sit at home and do idle things. They're actually involved in the care of their children and grandchildren or other people. It doesn't have to be children or grandchildren. It can be others or neighbors or anyone down the street. But they're all involved in some social activity where they care for other people. Yeah, you're right, Bill. I mean, you know, emulating the blue zones behaviors, which I try to do on more of a Mediterranean-type diet, I think is extremely beneficial. You know, worldwide right now we have 50 million people living with dementia. It's projected to increase to 152 million by 2050. This is an epidemic. And we have to look at all causes of dementia, not just Alzheimer's, but the nutritional aspects, the vascular aspects. But you can decrease dementia if you just follow the key, you know, even nine of the things that I just mentioned, including, you know, avoiding head injuries, obesity, diabetes, being active, plant-based diet predominantly. It doesn't have to be solely avoiding smoking, primary or secondary smoke inhalation, controlling your blood pressure, you know, encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss and reducing hearing loss by protecting the ears, and reducing air pollution, which is a tremendous cause of dementia. These little 2.5 micron particles in air pollution can go right into the brain. So living in polluted areas, you won't find any of the blue zones people, all these areas where they live a lot longer than the rest of us, in areas of significant air pollution. So air
