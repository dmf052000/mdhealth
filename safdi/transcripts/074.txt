Vitamins: Part 3 -  Do vitamins help prevent cancer?
Episode: 074

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I'm board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts focused on evidence-based medicine and health and wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie is a world-renowned investigator and gastroenterologist. He's been the principal investigator in about 300 peer-reviewed clinical research studies and co-investigator in more than 900 clinical research studies. Dr. Safdie, this is the third in our series of podcasts on vitamins. I just think it's such a great topic. Today I wanted to ask you, do vitamins reduce our risk of cancer? You know, Bill, I think this is a fascinating series of discussions in regards to vitamins and it's so important right now. Again, we need to look at our nutrients from food, not necessarily some supplements. And if we look at studies that have been done, adequate intake of certain nutrients, and we can discuss those, has been associated with reduction in all-cause mortality, meaning heart disease, cancer, strokes, you know. So all-cause mortality means the cause for anyone's death. If you put everyone together and put the number of people who die, that's called all-cause mortality. Is that right? Essentially, we'd only look at five major causes. So look at five of these major ones. We don't look at accidents. We don't look at suicides, things like that. But we look at heart disease. We look at central nervous systems like strokes. We look at dementia. We look at cancer. So, you know, those are our main, we don't really look at infectious diseases in regards to that. And if we look at adequate intake of certain nutrients, not by vitamins, but by diet, there was a decrease in people dying from those causes when the nutrient source is foods, not when the nutrient source was a pill. And so that's one of the things I want people to take away as a significant point in regards to these podcasts is, as we talked about before, vitamins are a minuscule amount. You know, the listing of vitamins that we have right now is not that many vitamins that we have. You know, we have our B vitamins. We have vitamin E. We have our fat-soluble vitamins. But these are things that are minimal compared to the phytochemical profile of a thousand different, many thousands of phytochemicals that come from the plant kingdom. So, you know, certain things we've looked at in regards to excess calcium intake actually was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality. And that was an older study. But it was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a well-reviewed, peer-reviewed study. Didn't I read a study saying that both vitamin C and vitamin E may have been increased, may be associated with increased lung tumors? Is that correct? Not that I've seen with vitamin C, but vitamin E. Vitamin E has had for many years, many, many years ago, we looked at 400 international units and 800 international units of vitamin E supplements, which you could buy in any drugstore. And there was up to a 10, depending on the study you looked at, 10 percent all the way up to 20 percent increase in mortality taking these higher doses of vitamin E. So if you're taking them, take them under a physician's guidance. You know, if we looked at, you know, dietary supplements, there was a previous study of 27, about 27,000 U.S. adults starting at age 20 and older. And researchers in those studies assessed whether adequate excessive nutrient intake was associated with death or whether from food versus supplement had an effect on the associations. And they found that, you know, adequate intake of vitamin K and magnesium by diet were associated with lower risk of death. And one of the things getting back to yours, vitamin, you know, adequate intake of vitamin A, vitamin K and zinc, again, by diet were associated with lower risk of death. Excessive calcium by supplement and very high doses were higher risk. But what we're looking at is all these associations were from foods, not from supplements. So calcium intake from food, actually, absolutely no increased risk. And the decreased risk came from foods. So if you want to. So what you're saying is really we should get our vitamins and hopefully much of our supplements from our diet, not from supplements. Is that correct? That's correct. I mean, there's certain things you may need. You may need B12 as you get older. You may need. And again, do that under a physician's guidance, because depending on the route of administration of B12, depending on why you have B12 deficiency, vitamin D, again, do it by monitoring your 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels. I have mine monitored every year. Initially, I knew what my peak and trough levels were. So the end of the summer, I checked it. And then at the end of the winter, I checked it again to see, do I need more in the winter than I do in the summer? So, you know, what we need to look at is, you know, getting adequate amounts of these phytochemicals, not just these other things from your diet, not necessarily from supplements. So there's, you know, there's pros and cons of taking diets. And, you know, there's certain supplements that you could take that may reduce. They're not necessarily vitamins, but some of these supplements boost or boast cancer fighting properties. Flax seeds, again, not by supplement. And they're found in certain cereals and breads. And, you know, you can get these. And there's been some association, you know, MD Anderson pointed out flax seeds contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and may counter the effects of chemotherapy. Garlic, there's been lots of studies on garlic for many years, highly touted as an anti-cancer effect. Not much downside to taking garlic. You know, it has... Except for your breath or if you're dating, you know. Yeah. It's been many years since I've been dating. So, you know, garlic appears to have biological underpinnings. And there was a study, I can't remember exactly when, in biomedicine and pharmacotherapy in regards to that. And, you know, garlic may have some basis in that. Adequate amount of selenium, not by supplement, but it boosts a list of other neoplastic properties other than just being an antioxidant. Maintains DNA stability, you know, stimulation of DNA repair. You can get selenium by lots of different mechanisms within your diet. So what are some of the foods that are in selenium? Selenium occurs naturally in soil. The amount varies geographically. Hopefully we haven't. But, you know, breads, grains, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, especially nuts. Brazil nuts have a tremendous amount. Adequate amounts are in your multivitamin if you happen to be taking that. Curcumin, which is one of the things I've been interested in for years, it's found in the spiced turmeric. And it's received plenty of attention. Agarwal, Gregory Cole, have all written about this. And not only in regards to cancer, but in regards to preservation of the central nervous system. But several studies have reported curcumin's anti-tumor effect on breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancers. You know, safety, efficacy, again, discuss that with your physicians. And, you know, we did talk about the benefits of vitamin D in regards to certain things. But observational studies, you know, when we look at people compared to latitudes, northern latitudes have more autoimmune disease and certain increased risk of cancer. So vitamin D may have an anti-neoplastic effect, meaning anti-cancer effect. The NIH supports a possible anti-neoplastic effect of vitamin D. So, you know, the bottom line is, you know, certain things may benefit you. Vitamins per se may not. Nutrient-dense foods containing essential vitamins and minerals and fiber are really important in your diet. It's not an option not to have a nutrient-dense diet. You know, please make sure you get these phytochemicals and other things that you need. And as I mentioned before, the vast majority are almost all come from the plant kingdom. Well, that was a great discussion, Alan. Let's keep talking about vitamins. Let's do this for our next podcast because I'd like to hear you talk about vitamin C and vitamin K specifically because there's a lot of press about those. If you like our podcast, please be sure to tell your friends about it and subscribe to our podcast. Thank you, Alan. Thanks, Bill. Take care of yourself.
