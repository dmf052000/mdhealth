How much protein do you need Part 2
Episode: 122

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Dr. William Renner, and it's my pleasure to host this series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. I'm the Emeritus Director of Radiology at the Ohio GI and Liver Institute. Dr. Alan Safdie is Chief Medical Officer of Quadrant Health, owned by Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Safdie served as Chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Gastroenterology at the Deaconess Hospital and Ohio GI Liver Institute, and has been elected President of the Ohio Gastroenterology Society. Dr. Safdie has been the primary investigator in more than 200 medical studies and co-investigator in more than 800 studies. Dr. Renner, today I'm talking with Dr. Alan Safdie. We're talking about the need for protein, especially as you get older, for maintaining a healthy muscle mass and a healthy weight. If you haven't heard our previous podcast on protein, please take a listen to this. Today we're going to talk about creatine. Now we see that all the time at the gym. When I go to the gym, there's all these young guys carrying these little containers around with their added protein. Alan, what's in those little containers those guys are carrying around? Well, I'm not sure what they're exactly carrying around, but I would imagine it's a protein powder, often a pea isolate. When I've asked a lot of them, there's a protein powder along with creatine. Creatine mixes much better in water or juice or other things. Protein powders are kind of gritty, even if they don't have any flavor. So what is creatine? Creatine is a naturally occurring compound. It's found in all our muscle cells. It's stored as phosphocreatine. And it regulates, it helps in regenerating ATP, ADP to ATP. I won't go into that. Those are the energy. Yeah, they're the cellular energy. Yeah, the ATPs. So we're taking one level and then we're generating the cellular energy. So what people have said over the years is it increases muscle strength and maybe increases mass, especially if you combine it with resistance training. It doesn't do anything if you're not really combining it with resistance training because it enhances the amount of energy available for those muscle contractions. It does not work instantly whatsoever. It's not an androgenic steroid. And it may support, which is one area of research that I'm fascinated with, brain energy metabolism. So, you know, can older adults take it? And that's a lot of people that ask me. And yes, it may be helpful. We're still in the infancy of research on this. It may benefit cognition and neuroprotection. It may reduce sarcopenia, which we talked about during the last, you know, podcast that we did. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass. But yeah, go ahead. Your age-related muscle loss, you know, all of us have some. You know, I would hate to, you know, generally safe. You know, there are some potential side effects to it. But it is a most studies on creatine have been done in the past on athletic performance. So that would take you and I out of that. And did it improve athletic performance? And yes, in a lot of studies, you know, for me to generate 5% more strength or force during a short workout really is going to mean very little because I'm not a competitive athlete at this point in my life. But for an athlete, yes, that may make a substantial difference. And it's been shown, you know, there was an analysis of multiple studies found that those who took creatine supplements while resistance training increased their lean body mass. And that's what we're interested in. That's why we were talking about previously DEXA scans and CT scans to evaluate where is their fat, you know, not what your weight is. We now use a body roundness index more than we do a body mass index. And we'll talk about that on a future podcast. But we're interested if you have fat arms and legs, it's not as great a risk as if you have fat around your pancreas and your liver. So we're interested in this lean body mass. So it is something that we're very interested in. And it's something that... So how much creatine should people take? If they're going to add some creatine to their diet, what form should they use and how do they take it? Well, most of the time, you know, if people ask, you know, one, it may affect your creatine, which is a blood test your doctor... You know, creatine is a small portion. It's created to creatine. So if you have renal disease, now if you're going to take any supplement, it's always talk to your doctor about it. But the kind that we usually recommend is creatine monohydrate. And it's, you know, it's probably the most pure form. And it may, you know, I'm not going to say boost energy. It's a means for these muscles to create energy. And you have to take it regularly. It does not something... It doesn't work if you just sit on your rear end. It doesn't really have any effect. And there are studies that, you know, it may improve the memory function. So how much would you take? I would start at a relatively low dose. You know, you can start, you know, a loading dose is not necessarily necessary. You know, a maintenance dose of about three to five grams per day. And definitely you can take it with water. You can take it with a meal. The insulin with a meal helps the creatine uptake into the cells. So creatine moves into the cells as insulin is secreted. So taking it on an empty stomach may not be as beneficial as taking it with a meal. Ensure adequate hydration with that. There's occasional side effects that... And I'm not sure they're real or not, but people have complained to me of minor GI problems with it, indigestion, bloating, you know, water retention. There's been no evidence in people with normal kidneys and healthy individuals that it causes renal disease. This is quite different than anabolic or androgenic steroids, which are high-risk agents. So I don't want people... And those agents in the past have been very heavily used. I know of high school teams. Even to this day, there's reports of high school teams where on the football teams or their track teams or the weightlifting teams, they have them take pills. And those are androgenic steroids. And those have serious side effects. Well, you're an expert in GI. The thing that I've seen is the radiologists are the liver tumors. But I've also seen heart valvular problems. What's been your experience with it? Well, they have major downside risk. So we don't recommend it to anybody. And they include things like testosterone, you know, that people are taking to build up muscle mass. Don't believe in that. You know, we use testosterone for people that have hypogonadism. But it's being abused for muscle growth. So the downsides are liver toxicity, as you mentioned, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia, which means breasts are getting larger, more aggression or behavioral disorders, acne, and a lot of these people when we see them come in. And, you know, do they have more elderly people? I'm not sure how we qualify elderly anymore. But, you know, there's an increase in atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and blood clots. So, you know, creatine we'll put in the relatively very safe category with adequate hydration. It's over-the-counter supplement. You know, where androgenic steroids are by prescription only. They're banned in sports. Muscle growth may be dramatic with androgenic steroids, which we don't recommend, but they're risky. Muscle growth with creatine may be more modest but sustainable. And will it help, you know, cognition and will it be neuroprotective? That's what we're looking at now. I'm encouraged that it makes sense, you know, that we're evaluating that. There was 16 clinical trials looking all the way from schizophrenia to Parkinson's disease. And, you know, there was some improvement, not as dramatic as you would like. But, you know, it may be beneficial. And we'll probably do another podcast on this next year as we get more and more evidence of disease. If you have renal disease, please always consult your doctor before you take that. Even if you don't, always tell your doctor about everything that you're doing. They're the gatekeeper of your health. So I think it's an interesting agent. At this point in time in my life, I have not taken it. I don't see any degradation in my muscle strength. But if I did at some point, I'm a vegetarian. Remember, we all make creatine ourselves. If you're eating meat, you're getting quite a bit of creatine. But we all make creatine. And it's not, you know, how much do we make? About two grams on average. So it is something that all of us do make. And it's not something that you have to take a supplement for. But I think it's an interesting idea to consider, you know, whether you're going to take a supplement for that. And we'll have to discuss that further. But I'm very encouraged by the data we've seen so far. Alan, this is another great topic. Stay tuned if you want to keep hearing these important topics on health and wellness with evidence-based medicine, not the supposition. All right, Alan, thank you. Thank you much. Thank you, Bill. And remember, you know, evidence-based medicine is substantiated by real research. And peer-reviewed articles. And we don't want to see that go away in this environment right now. Thank you, Alan. Take care.
