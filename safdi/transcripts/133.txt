CT scans and radiation
Episode: 133

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Dr. William Renner, and it's my pleasure to host this series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. I'm the Emeritus Director of Radiology at the Ohio GI and Liver Institute. Dr. Alan Safdie is Chief Medical Officer of Quadrant Health, owned by Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Safdie served as Chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Gastroenterology at the Deaconess Hospital and Ohio GI Liver Institute, and has been elected President of the Ohio Gastroenterology Society. Dr. Safdie has been the primary investigator in more than 200 medical studies and co-investigator in more than 800 studies. All right, today, Alan, let's talk about a recent study about the radiation exposure in CAT scans. As a radiologist, I know that's a very important problem, and we've made some great progress in that. But let me give you a minute and have you discuss the article. Thank you, Bill. I think this is a really important article, and I think what we can do is discuss in detail not just what the article brought up, but opens up a whole new line of discussion. Are we doing too many CAT scans that are really not worthwhile? But the study highlights how cancer risk from the CT scans performed daily. And as you know, Bill, CAT scans are performed, if you come to the emergency room, if you have a complaint, they automatically order the CAT scan. And this is like... Yeah, I can tell you as a radiologist that in the emergency room, most emergency rooms in the United States now, the nurses see the patient and order the CAT scan before the doctor examines them. That's just the policy. I don't know if that's because of the shortage of physicians or just the ease of getting CAT scans, but they're very commonly done for almost all types of complaints. Certainly anyone with abdominal pain, chest pain, headache, are all going to get a CAT scan now. Well, and we have a lot of CAT scans being done in the United States, approximately 23. About 93 million scans performed a year. One of the reasons is that if you come in with abdominal pain, you're just not going to get a CT of your abdomen and pelvis. You're going to get a CT of your pelvis and maybe a CT of your chest. So we have three CAT scans. They're all separate CAT scans and a significant amount of radiation associated with this. So let's briefly talk about radiation. So what many people don't know is that the CAT scanner works on the basis of radiation. The radiation dose is significant. But remember, there's radiation just living in the United States. Taking a plane flight to Denver has about the same amount of radiation as a chest x-ray. But a CT scan has significantly more radiation. The other imaging tools we have, such as an MR machine, does it work on radiation? It works basically on the sound's radio frequency, like a TV. It works off the same frequency that TV channels emit. So there's essentially no radiation with a MR scanner. And ultrasound does not have any radiation. So there are other exams that can be done without any radiation exposure to patients. But go on with what you were saying, Alan. So the radiation exposure in these CAT scans is not negligible. And we're talking, if I just give you the example of two millisieverts, which is actually relatively low for a CAT scan. And now if you talk about the newer CAT scanners and millibill, but that's equivalent to about 100 chest x-rays. If I told you I'm going to do 100 chest x-rays on you, you'd go, wait a minute, I don't want 100 chest x-rays done. The abdominal and pelvis CTs are substantially higher and may be equivalent to 10 millisieverts in some of the newer CT scans, maybe about three millisieverts, but still a couple hundred chest x-ray equivalents. The problem is that we're not asking our doctors, is this a newer CAT scan? How much, you know, there's a big difference between the new CT scanners and the old CT scanners. We're not asking them, is there another way to approach this disease? I had people getting CAT scans for gallstones where an ultrasound would have been a lot better test with zero radiation. You said MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, and it's right in the name, magnetic resonance imaging, does not emit radiation, whereas the CAT scanners do. And it's not that we don't need CAT scans, we absolutely do need these. They're very good tests, but they need to be used judiciously and not routinely. But remember, newer CT scanners deliver significantly less radiation compared to old CT scanners. Yeah, one of the goals of the CT manufacturers is to markedly reduce the radiation. And the radiation of a new CAT scanner is one third to the very new, one fifth the amount of radiation. So a marked difference if you have an updated scanner versus an old scanner. And unfortunately, in some of the older hospitals or rural hospitals, they have what we call an eight slice or a 16 slice scanners, while the new scanners have more than a thousand slices. That's how many slices they do per second. So markedly, markedly more rapid scans with much, much, much less radiation. So it does become important. Other factors that I think are important is that children are more susceptible to radiation because their skulls, if you're doing a brain CT, their skulls are much thinner than that of adults. And the other thing that radiation does have an effect on is reproductive organs such as the ovaries or the testes. So people who are in reproductive age, there's actual some calculable risk. In older persons like you or I, I think the risk is relatively negligible myself. However, I think the goal of all radiologists should be to replace CAT scans completely with MR. And right now, assuming that research continues, and that's a big if right now, but assuming that if research continues, I think that in the next several years, maybe 10 years or so, CAT scans will be replaced by MR machines that emit no radiation. What are your thoughts, Alan? We hope so, but right now there's a lot of diseases I deal with who are CT scanned. At this point in time, it's still maybe better than MR. There's conditions where MR is substantially better than CT scan. But remember, currently CT is the state of art for many diseases, especially GI diseases that you're involved with, because the GI tract moves. It actually moves, right? Your GI tract moves. It's called peristalsis. Yeah, it moves like a snake. Yeah, and the MR is not very good at that. Yeah, the MR is extremely sensitive to motion. So any movement, such as even movement of the bowels that we're not even aware of, sometimes you hear there's little squeaks in your stomach or whatever, that's your bowel moving. It does that constantly. That markedly affects the MR machine. But you know, I think this is a good lesson for us. I mean, are there problems potentially with this study? Yes. I mean, this study compared a huge high-dose radiation compared to something given over a long period of time, meaning the atomic bomb survivors from a single high-dose radiation, which would be several millisieverts, I mean, several sieverts, not millisieverts, you know, all at once. Also, air pollution, you've heard from those bombs and other things, but it does bring up that there's, you know, always ask your doctors a different way we can approach this. Is this the best way? What kind of CAT scanner is it? You know, a 32-slice CT scanner, which is pre-2010, is going to have 7 to 10 millisieverts of radiation. The one Bill was just talking about, the state-of-the-art 1,024-slice CT scanner, is going to have 0.5 to 2 millisieverts. So, you know, one-fifth or even less radiation exposure by going to a place that has newer ones. You know, do I need to have these as often? If somebody says I'm ordering the abdomen and pelvis, well, what are you exactly looking at? In some places, people are getting whole-body CT scans. If I'm getting a whole-body study, which I never am probably going to, you know, just to take a look at what's going on in my body, I would do an MR, which, again, is a magnetic resonance imaging device, zero radiation exposure. All right, Alan, great talk. Thank you, Bill, and have a good day.
