Vaccines can help prevent dementia
Episode: 131

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Dr. William Renner, and it's my pleasure to host this series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. I'm the Emeritus Director of Radiology at the Ohio GI and Liver Institute. Dr. Alan Safdie is Chief Medical Officer of Quadrant Health, owned by Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Safdie served as Chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Gastroenterology at the Deaconess Hospital and Ohio GI Liver Institute, and has been elected President of the Ohio Gastroenterology Society. Dr. Safdie has been the primary investigator in more than 200 medical studies and co-investigator in more than 800 studies. All right, Alan, I have a question for you today. Could a single shot and a RSV shot today protect your brain and your health for years to come? Good question, Bill. And obviously, I think you know what my answer is going to be because I know the answer to that. Shingles, what we have right now is we have an older shingles shot that's called the Shingrix, S-H-I-N-G-R-I-X, may prevent death indirectly as shingles in itself rarely kills, but it can have serious outcomes like stroke and central lysis gets in your brain, pneumonia. One of the bad things you can get is if you have persistent pain, which is called post-traumatic neuralgia, and this shooting pain in those areas where the nerve roots were infected by this virus is almost at risk for this. Yeah, that's terrible. I've seen patients come into the office crying from that disease. And there's lots of other vaccines that can prevent death. Yes, RSV, and we'll talk about that in a minute. Flu vaccines, there's 20,000 to 50,000 deaths annually in the U.S. from flu. Is it always effective? No, effectiveness varies by the year, and the best guess of what the current is going to be. RSV is a very effective vaccine in approximately 80% effectiveness in the brain, 60 plus age group. And you have to talk to your doctors if you're a candidate for that. So let's talk about dementia and the shingles vaccine, because this is a new recent study. And it's interesting, and the shingles vaccine may prevent one in five dementia cases. It was a headline from these studies. Why is that important? Because dementia is increasing as our populations get older. There's 57 million people worldwide that probably have dementia, probably a clinical way. Yeah, as I've said before, dementia is my greatest fear. You know, my best friend in high school recently died from dementia. And he was an athlete and a physician. So, I mean, dementia is very frightening to me. And there's multiple types of dementia. So there's vascular dementia, there's different types of dementia. There's a late limbic associated temporal encephalopathy dementia. There's Alzheimer's dementia, PD43. But, you know, it's projected to triple over the next 25 years. And, you know, there's a lot of reasons people can get dementia, age, genetics, vascular diseases. But one of the things we haven't looked at around is viral infections. And one viral infection linked to an increase of dementia is shingles. And shingles is this dormant chickenpox virus, and almost all of us have had chickenpox at some point. And it reactivates in our nerve cells. And this research suggested that vaccination against shingles could reduce the risk of dementia by 20%. In a really high-risk population, which is our older population with this. So it's interesting, it's important. It's something to talk to your doctors about. But demonstrating that vaccination against shingles to prevent this reactivation of this virus can reduce the risk of dementia. And it's the strongest evidence yet on dementia and shingles. It's a study out of Wales. And, you know, the original shingles vaccine was a live, attenuated, weakened vaccine. So there's different types of vaccines. There's vaccines that are inactivated live viruses. And Wales at that time had a live, attenuated shingles vaccine. And then we have Shingrix, which is not a live, attenuated vaccine. Essentially, we have that vaccine. So those people who received the shingles vaccine had a significant reduction in dementia diagnosis. So it's the same vaccine we're using now. It's similar. We're not using the attenuated vaccine. We were at that time. But it's a very cost-effective way of eliminating dementia in the United States. And there are times vaccines have the same benefit. You know, it's a recombinant zoster vaccine. So it's not a live vaccine. I think it will have the same benefits, in my opinion, because this study has really strong evidence of the link between shingles vaccination and lower dementia risk. Yeah, in my mind, just another reason to get that shingles vaccine. Number one being shingles, extremely painful disease, can sometimes lead to blindness. And now the fact that there's a demonstration that it leads to dementia, even an extremely more important reason, consider the vaccine. Talk to your doctor about it. And then the other thing that we should mention is there's, you know, we know after somebody gets a viral infection, and so we talked, you know, about this chickenpox virus. But let's talk for a second about RSV because it's another interesting study. And, you know, the headline to this study, if I remember correctly, was RSV triples a person's risk of death over the next year or within a year. So it was a Danish study, and people that had RSV raised the risk of death, not just when they had RSV, but over the next year are 2.7 times higher. That's huge. Yeah, that's huge. And there are three RSV vaccines available in the United States. Uptake has been extremely sluggish, although high ahead. As a vaccine. As a vaccine. But we're both vaccine believers. We deal with people who get sick and die. So, yeah, if you're in hospitals and you're around people in the ICU situation, you know, you're going to be exposed to it. And, you know, this study conveys just how serious RSV can be. Is it recommended for everybody? No, it's something to talk to your doctor if you're in the age 60 and over or above. And, you know, a lot of people have preexisting conditions, and in that group, if they're 60 and over, definitely recommended. And this was an interesting study at Copenhagen. There was over 5,000 adults diagnosed with RSV, and they followed them for, I don't know if it all comes with a year, and they compared it to 15,000 controls. So it wasn't a small study. You know, we're not talking about death, but we're not talking about rate of hospitalization. You know, RSV, the rate of hospitalization goes way up. You know, if I'm a member of that RSV, not in the high-risk group, did fine, but coughed incessantly for a couple months. So those are things, but did you receive the vaccine prior to this? You know, the enthusiasm for this vaccine has not been met. You know, there's not an enthusiastic response to this vaccine, which happens with a lot of vaccines. Yeah, I've seen several people, older people with RSV who've been sick, coughed incessantly for weeks and weeks and weeks. Impressive how uncomfortable they are. Yeah, well, a lot of people, and patients may not be that aware that the vaccine even exists. You know, there's a lot of eligible patients, and even the physicians aren't talking to their patients about it, and we're seeing people come in that are eligible for the vaccine, and they never even knew the vaccine existed. You know, so age 75 and older, you know, I think that I can make, you know, a relatively strong recommendation to consider it and talk to your doctor. 60 to 74, if you have risk factors for RSV, you know, I think it's very worthwhile to talk to them. But the fascinating study, along with the shingles study, these are two recent, you know, studies that are talking about vaccinations that could show potentially significant benefits. Yeah, great talk, Alan. And just like all of our talks, these talks are designed to make you think and give you up-to-date information so that you could talk to your doctor. Every individual is different. We're just trying to stimulate, give you some more information, give you as much accurate and truthful information that we can so that you can discuss this with your physician. I appreciate it, Bill. And as Bill said, any recommendations, and if you have any complaints on our podcast, please discuss these with your physicians and do them wisely and appropriately. And notify your physicians if you're at your wellness program or your health plan or whatever you have in your nutrition or talk about exercise and muscle strength. And be talking about stretching and meditation and other things in the future too. But always the physicians, you know, what you're doing to keep yourself healthy. Health plan is probably more important than just lifespan. You know, how many years you can spend healthy, not just how long you live. Thank you, Alan. I think these lectures with evidence-based medicine, that is medicine that has been peer-reviewed by other physicians and other important colleagues are so important to give people now. We are living in an age of misinformation. Let's face it, we all are. I agree with that. Thank you, Alan. I appreciate it.
