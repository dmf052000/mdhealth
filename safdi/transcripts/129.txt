Colon cleansing from a GI doctor
Episode: 129

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie. We are happy to be hosting the Evidence-Based Medical Podcast on Wellness. We are both acclaimed board-certified physicians. Alan, let's continue our discussions of biohacking. I want to hear about your take on colon cleansing. Bill, that's close to my heart when people come in and say, I'm trying to cleanse my colon. I said, okay, what are you doing? You're eating a high-fiber diet, you're exercising, you're drinking plenty of fluids. They go, no, I'm taking this or that agent. So they're foregoing the healthy parts of the lifestyle that cleanse our colon. Our colon is self-cleansing. There's not a lot of debris that stays stuck in there. Things move through quite well. There's a lot of bacteria in there. The number of cells in our body, 10% of them are human and 90% are bacterial and viral-type cells that we have in our body. And that stuff, we think of the colon as almost our second brain. So keeping it healthy is very important. It's a bidirectional messaging system between the colon and our brain. Yeah, as I understand what you're saying is that the bacteria that live in our colon, and there's lots and lots, literally billions and trillions of different types of bacteria, they're all biologically active and that they secrete hormones and other substances that are absorbed by our body that go to the brain and other organs. Is that correct? That's correct, but some of them directly through nerves, such as the vagal nerve and other nerves, directly from the GI tract up towards our brain. Keeping those bacteria healthy are paramount to a long, healthy life. There's other things we do, but keeping them healthy, overuse of antibiotics, poor diets and other things, we have more inflammatory bacteria. We have more heart disease potentially. We have more brain neurodegenerative diseases. So keeping those bacteria healthy are very reasonable. So people decided, well, we're going to do colon cleansing to keep them healthy, which is kind of an ancient practice. It involves flushing the colon to remove waste from the body. And it's considered beneficial based on the belief that it prevents a buildup of waste in the colon. And it says, well, that's harmful to your health. Let me explain a little bit what the colon does. It's a fluid absorptive organ. So if you're dehydrated, which a lot of people are, the colon contractions slow down. It allows the body to take more fluid out of the poop that gets to the colon and the bacteria. 50% of the poop volume is dead bacteria and 50% is the dietary fiber and other things that you take in. But it sucks more water out of there. The stool becomes harder and people, the transit time is less. So if people, the transit time is less, there's lots of things we look at, dietary fiber, exercise patterns, fluid ingestion, urine specific gravity, lots of things we look at. So let me not digress too much, but let's get back to colon cleansing. You know, can it be dangerous? You know, a lot of individuals reported to me feeling less bloated afterwards. But can it be dangerous? Yes, we've seen problems with it. You know, electrolyte abnormalities. So you're putting in fluids, hopefully sterile, often not. You know, just tap water in a lot of patients or high dose salt ones. So we see, you know, electrolyte imbalance. Can it dehydrate the body? Yes, absolutely. Can it precipitate abnormal contractions or arrhythmias of the heart? Yes. Have there been deaths from these things? Yes. And, you know, do the people that are doing it, especially if you're doing it by enema forms, not damage the colon. They can put a tube and perforate the colon. Perforating a colon because of all that bacteria that we were just talking about can cause significant harmful bacteria to get in your peritoneum or your abdominal cavity and in your bloodstream. So it is something that we're very concerned about. But, you know, the claims of removing toxins from the colon, improving digestion type claims, you know, resets the gut health. It does not reset the gut health. It does not improve digestion. Digestion does not occur in the colon. Digestion occurs in the small intestine predominantly where the food, the nutrients are absorbed through the small intestine. And, you know, you have 20-something feet of intestines and you have six feet of colon. Most of the absorptive processes for food and nutrients occur in the small intestine. So, you know. Alan, what I get the most calls about are coffee enemas. Because apparently there are some celebrities that promote coffee enemas. And in certain parts of the country, that appears to be kind of a rage. Do you want to comment on coffee enemas? And have you ever given yourself a coffee enema? Luckily, in my life, I've never had an enema, nor do I plan on having one. But there's water enemas. There's coffee enemas. There's herbal enemas. There's electrolyte, salt enemas. There's cold, you know, colon hydrotherapy, pressure-infused water under high pressure that goes into the colon, which in some institutions they use for colon cleansing prior to a colonoscopy. Alan, let me comment on enemas first, since you've never had one. My grandmother, if I stayed home from school, I would get an enema. To me, it was quite an unpleasant experience. And I don't see how anyone could even consider it to be enjoyable. But continue on with your discussion of the coffee enema. Yeah, I mean, you know. Because when people tell me about doing a coffee enema, I kind of cringe at the whole idea. I mean, there's other ways of doing this orally. They'll take high-dose herbal laxatives or teas or pills. But there's zero evidence, and let me reemphasize that, zero evidence that colon cleansing removes any toxins or improves health in healthy people. None. I mean, if somebody's impacted with stool, yeah, we'll use, and nothing's moving through, we will use enemas at times. The colon has multiple, very robust mechanisms to eliminate waste. And, you know, the microbiome, those bacteria, that there can be harm, whether it be by orally trying to cleanse the colon or by, you know, mechanically with enemas, you know, can be harmed by these therapies. Coffee's very healthy, but you have to take it orally and enjoy it. It's not healthy when it's put up your rectum. One, you won't enjoy it. And secondly, it doesn't have the same benefits. So we want to avoid these electrolyte imbalances. We want to avoid infections because of poorly sanitized equipment. We don't want to disturb this microbiome, which we work our whole lives to keep healthy by our healthy diets and exercise and our other patterns and only taking antibiotics if absolutely necessary. And we don't want to develop a dependence on laxatives. And let me digress to that for a second. There's a lot of people that think that they need stimulant laxatives long-term. If you do that, you'll need more and more and more. It's called tachyphylaxis. So if you need two of these stimulant laxatives for the first few months, you might need three the next six months. You might need four. The colon relies on that, becomes addicted to those stimulant laxatives. And the official positions from most institutions, I don't know any that take anything different, but, you know, Mayo Clinic has definitely said there's no medical benefits and significant potential harms, same as Hopkins and CFDA. And detox is not a medical term. It's not, you're not detoxing anything. You're probably adding potential toxins, but you're not detoxing anything at all in there. So, you know, claims that you're flushing toxins from the body, aiding weight loss and increased energy, improved liver, it does not improve liver function, doesn't improve kidney function or renal function. So whether it be detox teas, whether it be colon cleansers, juice cleansers, you know, be very careful when you're doing those. Yeah, let me comment. You brought up a really good point is that people watch, use the internet and if you're going to use the internet for health, just be aware that about 95% of things that are on the internet are untruth. They're products that people are trying to sell you. They're making things up so that you'll buy products. They'll make money. If you're going to use it for medical advice, go to reliable sources like the Mayo Clinic or the Cleveland Clinic or John Hopkins. Those are all three very reliable sources. What about AI? AI, I use it constantly. I'm writing newsletters almost on a daily basis. I have a review by AI. It does not know what good medicine is. It makes errors at least 30% of the time and if it doesn't know the answer, it tries to please you. It will actually make things up. It's called hallucinate. It does this 10 to 20% of the time when there's no answer available on the internet. But that's my last editorial comment. All right, Alan, thanks. I think you've debunked some of these crazy claims about coffee and other types of cleansing and given us some ideas of how to safely keep our colon cleansed. Do you have any last comments? No, be careful. Healthy lifestyle as we get back to all the time. I am going to talk the next time of what I'd like to talk about because somebody called me last evening and said that Oprah and other people on social media are promoting natural GLP-1s or GLP-1 agonists naturally. And they said that Mayo Clinic, who I work for Quadrant, which is co-owned by Mayo Clinic and Stanford University, is promoting that. And other institutions, including Harvard
