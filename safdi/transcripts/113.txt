Timing of meals and exercise to prevent or improve diabetes
Episode: 113

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine. We're back on the air. Dr. Safti and I have been very busy. Dr. Safti is the chief medical officer for Quadrant Health at Stanford University, and we've both been very tied up working with that, but we've both now made a commitment to get back to our podcast and try to get some really good material out there on evidence-based medicine. Today, we're going to talk about diabetes, a worldwide problem, more than 537 million individuals now with diabetes. Alan, I wanted to talk to you about timing of meals because there's been a lot of information published about that recently, and I think it's a very important topic. What can you tell me about timing of meals in helping to prevent or mitigate the problems of diabetes? It's a good question, Bill, and we have some more recent evidence that I think everybody's going to be interested in, but this is, as you mentioned, 537 million adults worldwide with this. It's not just a problem in the United States, but it's a problem that's a worldwide problem. The global prevalence is over 10% of adults ages 20 to 79 have diabetes, and if we include prediabetes, meaning your hemoglobin A1c and your blood sugars are elevated but not quite what we call diabetes yet, it's much greater. There's a tremendous number of people that have diabetes or prediabetes, which is characterized by high blood sugar or insulin resistance and relative impairment in the insulin secretion. Pathogenesis is significantly heterogeneous, meaning there's genetic factors that can lead to it, environmental factors such as obesity, and some new evidence that we have. As you mentioned, can fewer meals help prevent type 2 diabetes and obesity? Intermittent fasting has been the rage for a long period of time. A lot of celebrities and other people have said intermittent fasting, and we're not going to talk about significantly prolonged fasting. We're going to talk about things that aren't unreasonable and things that you can do that may help. In a recent review, and this is found that specific type of restricted eating, and I'm not talking about missing breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes as well as improve your overall health and maybe your weight. So we're going to call it time-restricted eating. This type of fasting, what we're talking about is maybe having regular but fewer meals and definitely, definitely cutting out the late-night snacks. So say you eat dinner at 7 o'clock at night, you may not eat breakfast until 9 or 10 in the morning. So you're going to have this 12 to 14-hour period of relative fasting. It isn't hard for me because I don't eat snacks late at night anyway, and I work out before I eat in the morning. But why would this help? We used to tell people three meals a day and you can have snacks, but that prevents your insulin levels from going down during the day. That prevents your blood sugar from going down during the day. And that can overload the body's insulin receptors, and that leads to this insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. And it also, that's why sometimes it's hard to lose body fat. We're not giving our bodies a chance to use up all this energy we threw into it with those meals. So if you have fewer meals or fewer snacks, we'll allow these fat deposits to potentially be used as a source of energy rather than keep consuming sugar and calories. So this new approach, it's not really a new approach. I mean, this is what people did for centuries, but we started having snacks late at night. But we know this time-restricted eating allows the body time to have lower insulin levels and lower glucose levels, which improve. So basically you're saying have your meal at 6.30 or 7, but after that don't eat anything else and then try not to eat for till 9 or 10 in the morning. Yeah, or at least 7 or 8 in the morning. At least have that 12 hours. Don't have a snack. And one of the worst things would be don't have a soft drink. Don't have, you know, even if it's a glass of orange juice that has relative simple sugars in it. Orange has complex carbohydrates in with it. Orange juice, we're basically having sugar. So there's a big difference between an orange and orange juice, big difference between apple juice and an apple. But a lot of people think, okay, I'm not eating, so I'm going to have these, you know, I'm just going to have a Coke or I'm going to have even worse would be, you know, one of the non-caloric sweeteners that we put into a soft drink or other things. But, you know, we need to give our bodies time to metabolize and use the sugars that we put in there. You know, and it changes, not only will it change your potential insulin resistance, but it may change the bacteria and other microbiomes, you know, the microorganisms in our digestive tract. So we think that fasting may positively affect, you know, your microbiome, which is really important. And it may stave off some inflammation and a variety of metabolic disorders. So, you know, these late night snacks or eating dinner close to bedtime may affect your melatonin levels. You know, endogenous melatonin levels are high. And this is when you eat late at night and when the melatonin levels are high, you know, it's associated with decreased insulin secretion, decreased glucose tolerance. So there's some genetic carriers, the GI allele and other things has to do with receptors, but a little bit more complex. But late night eating is not something we should do on a regular basis if you do it occasionally. But, you know, remember melatonin, which is a hormone primarily released at night that helps us control the sleep-wake matters, typically rise about two hours before bedtime. And we don't want to, you know, disrupt that. And we don't want to disrupt our normal circadian rhythms. Now, what about, you know, what else can you do besides this? Because this sounds too simple. Bill, when do you exercise? I try to exercise in the morning. I usually try to walk on a stair climber for about 45 minutes a morning. And then I'll do just some setups and push-ups. And then later in the day, I try to get 10,000 steps in. Okay. No, that's great. You know, we're not really sure, and the evidence I'm going to give you right now is we need some more evidence to prove this. But, you know, is it better to exercise in the morning, in the afternoon, evening? And I, like you, exercise in the morning because it's very easy for me to get up very early and exercise then. And the first of a study to investigate how insulin resistance that can lead to type 2 diabetes can be treated by exercise. You know, the researchers in this study found exercise in the morning did not reduce insulin resistance in the study's participants. That's fascinating to me. That's interesting. But exercise in the afternoon. We're doing it all wrong. Well, I have for a lifetime, and I will continue to probably do it all wrong because I don't have time later in the day. But exercising in the afternoon and evening was more beneficial. So moderate to vigorous physical activity in the afternoon led to an 18% reduction in insulin resistance, 25% reduction in the evening compared to physical activity throughout the day. So, you know, is that the only thing you do? You know, the duration of exercise, well, timing may be critical. Again, this is the first of studies to really look at this. Did they say much about the duration or is it just timing is what they discussed? Yeah, they were really looking at timing, but they did another one where another study looked at two-minute bursts of physical activity, totaling 15 minutes a week, which isn't very much, but significant activity. So, you know, late in the day when you take a walk, you do a very rapid walk just for two minutes at a time every day. You know, that's 14 minutes a week. And that was associated with reduced risk of death, cancer, and heart disease. Yeah, I've always tried to do a little bit of interval training, like every five minutes I try to walk or go very fast on the treadmill for two minutes. Just like you said, interval training has been passed. People have talked about that, at least giving you better strength. This is the first time I've heard it had any effect on diabetes. Well, think of it as an activity snack also during the day. Instead of a snack of food, you know, when you're prolonged sitting, which I do a lot at the computer or teaching and stuff, you can build muscles by using more amino acids from the foods that you eat. So, you know, we want to have effective exercise, you know, according to all these studies, kind of woven into the fabric of our entire life. You know, so, you know, taking out the garbage, volunteer, you know, body weight squats throughout the day. My wife volunteers for me. She volunteers for me. But, you know, think about, you know, even if you're going to exercise in the morning, as you do, take a walk in the evening. You know, get that exercise later in the day, especially if there's any element of insulin resistance, whether it be prediabetes. And I recommend everybody have a hemoglobin A1C checked. Talk to your doctors about that. But I don't have diabetes and I have mine checked routinely when I get around to having a physical exam. But these activity snacks later in the day may be very important. But it's fascinating that, you know, the timing of your exercise may make a difference. Well, that's really great. Actually, I'm glad you talked about
