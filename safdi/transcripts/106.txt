The role of a high fiber diet in preventing dementia
Episode: 106

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based wellness. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and specialist in nutrition. Alan, let's talk about dementia. That's a topic that just scares the bejeebers out of me. What can we do to help prevent dementia? Some people have talked about high-fiber diets. What do you think? Bill, that's a really good question. Roughly half of all the adults in the United States have at least one preventable chronic disease. It's just a tremendous amount of diseases that are preventable. A lot of those are related to poor eating habits along with a sedentary lifestyle. So what we look at is dietary guidelines in regards to fiber that we're consuming. And we find out a lot of people are not consuming enough fiber. And why is fiber so important? One, to make you poop. So without fiber, you may have some constipation. But it also feeds the bacteria that are in us, the microbiome or the microbiota that live within us. And feeding them is actually... By that, you're talking about the bacteria that primarily live in our colon? Is that what you mean? Yeah, the vast majority of them. They live in your mouth. They live in your colon, a little bit in the distal ileum. They live on our skin. But we're talking about the ones in the gastrointestinal tract and predominantly, you're right. And they're important because they're metabolically active, as I understand it. They're not just sitting there. They're taking in nutrients and they're actually producing substances that our body absorbs. And that's why they're so important. Is that right? Yeah, I mean, they produce things like butyrate, which you don't have to remember the names of these things. The substances that sustains mucosal health, the lining health of the bowel. It helps with the immunologic defenses. And we've all heard about T cells lately in regards to COVID. But they help in regards to immunologic defenses by stimulating the regulatory T cells. They help in regards to our weight. They help in microbial metabolism, the bacteria being metabolized. They help in regards to the amount of inflammation within our body. And some of them can help in reducing carcinogenesis, the development of cancer. So, you know, microbes, these bacteria, these little guys, you know, there's 10 times more of those in our human cells in our body. You know, they help. They digest the remaining cell walls of plants, releasing biochemicals, which are chemicals that are biologically active. And those chemicals... So we literally have billions of these organisms live in our body that are metabolically active, taking our food that we eat and transforming it into substances, some of them hormonal-like substances that we actually are going to absorb. So that they actually have a great deal of influence on what, you know, in a way they're a medication, right? They're giving us medications, if you want to think of it that way. Think of it as better than a medication. You know, most of our medications have a lot of potential side effects. These good bacteria are preventative, much more so than a lot of medications we take in. You know, to give you an example, you know, we've always heard that eating, that we should eat a lot of fiber, you know, important for our digestion, but it's also important for your heart. You know, it can help even reduce cholesterol. And there was a study recently published in Nutritional Neuroscience, and this came out of Japan, and this high-fiber diet was associated with reducing risk of developing dementia just by increasing the diet. And you're absolutely right, because that fiber, we end up producing chemicals that have beneficial effects on our brain. And they assessed a heck of a lot of patients over a long period of time from 1985 to 1999. All right, now tell me what fiber is. I mean, what do we eat that turns into fiber or is fiber? What counts as fiber? Well, there's two main types of fiber. There's soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. So soluble fiber, I'll give you some examples, would be found in foods such as oats. And if you're going to eat oatmeal, you know, have steel-cut oats, the least processed oats that you can have. Legumes, even peanuts and things like that, are extremely important for the beneficial bacteria that live in the gut as well, providing other health benefits. So legumes are like peanuts and lentils? Is that the main thing? Yeah, peas, things like that, pea pods, you know, edamame, things like this that you want to consume. You know, I actually have peanuts in my oatmeal every morning, along with my chia seeds, my flax seeds, and all these other soluble and insoluble fibers in my fruit. Insoluble fibers are a lot of vegetables and a lot of whole grains. So wheat bread... Like broccoli and lettuce or what? Broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce doesn't really have very much fiber in it, but, you know, cauliflower, broccoli, cruciferous vegetables. A lot of fruits will even have some insoluble fibers in it. Like apples, you mean? Apples, blueberries, blackberries, all these have... There's no fiber in them. So people think on a predominantly animal-based diet, they're going to get in enough fiber. They're not. And by having a combination of these soluble fibers and these insoluble fibers, the insoluble ones may be more beneficial in regards to poop and constipation and things like that. And we know that we found this link between fiber intake and dementia. More pronounced, interestingly, for soluble fibers, and that kind of makes sense because these soluble fibers may be more beneficial to the bacteria. So more of the thing in the oat family. But they're both beneficial. You know, the mechanisms are somewhat unknown because we don't know all the substances these bacteria produce. You know, and how does it... What's going on in your gut affect your brain? And one possibility is that the soluble fiber regulates the composition of the bacteria within us. And that bacteria may affect the inflammation that's going on in our brain. And inflammation plays a role in the onset of dementia. So, you know, we don't consume enough fiber. So how do we increase the fiber in our diet? I mean, other than oatmeal and broccoli, what else can we do? A Mediterranean diet for them? No. I mean, we don't need... You know, we always in the United States, compared to most places, look for an answer and a pill. You know, we need a more Mediterranean or the new Nordic diet where we're looking for bright colored foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains. You know, start looking at packages. Don't, you know, if you're eating meat and if you're eating a lot of poultry, have smaller portions, but, you know, have more Brussels sprouts, have more broccoli, have more cauliflower, have more whole grain products. You know, if you're making oatmeal, have steel cut oats. I mean, I make three or four days at a time and just leave it in the refrigerator. But, you know, we know that this higher intake of dietary fibers, not just dementia, but associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. And again, same sort of thing, this high fiber intake, reduce inflammation and subsequently have led to lower risk of cardiovascular disease. You know, cereal fibers, which are the grain fibers, may decrease inflammation. These whole grains and, you know, like the old fibers and the soluble fibers may decrease inflammation even more than the vegetable fibers. But the vegetable fibers have benefits in and of themselves. So, you know, think like I am going to eat whole foods. If you pick up a package of anything and it's got 20 ingredients, you don't have to read them all. You don't want to buy it. So, you know, buy whole foods, fresh fruits, vegetables, you know, nuts, beans. Beans are tremendously beneficial. And you can tell how much the bacteria like them by the amount of gas you produce. I mean, you know, when you're eating beans, the gas is being, it's a byproduct of fermentation of the cell walls of those beans that the bacteria are fermenting and they're using to create these beneficial chemicals. So intestinal gas is not always bad. But, you know, let's focus on a healthier diet. We can improve our heart. We can probably improve our brain. And we can improve our gastrointestinal tract. And so... Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a winning combination because, I mean, dementia is probably, as I get older, that's the one thing I fear the most. But heart disease, of course, is a real fear. And anything that can help with your lifestyle, bowel movements, things like that, that's like bowel movements are what some of the older women in our neighborhood, that's all they seem to talk about. So fiber kind of sounds like it's an answer to a lot of these problems. Yeah, and just remember, we have a tremendous amount of preventable diseases in the United States that can be prevented by looking at our eating habits and our sedentary lifestyle. And by abiding by that, and one, you'll enjoy your diet. It gives you a lot of variety. You know, nothing better than going to a farmer's market, buying a bunch of these things and, you know, stir frying them up or whatever you want to do with these. But, you know, think about if you don't have a very colorful breakfast, you know, colorful meal, you're not getting in enough fiber. So...
