Covid-19 Vaccine Update
Episode: 080

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine. It's my honor to interview Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist today and internist. I myself am board-certified in internal medicine and radiology. Today I want to talk about COVID and what's the latest on COVID. Alan, both you and I have received our first doses of the vaccine being healthcare workers. Are we protected yet? Well, Bill, let's step back a little bit and see where we are and where we've come from. Early in the year, we predicted the rollout was not going to be smooth because we need the infrastructure built out. It's not just vaccine development. It's vaccine administration, storage, other things. Where we are, the world's passed 2 million COVID-19 deaths right now. We've passed what we lost in World War II in the United States. It's hard for people to conceptualize how much 2 million people are that we've lost from this. But imagine, Bill, that every single day, 10 large commercial jets, some of the largest commercial jets possible, fell out of the sky, 10 of them a day, every single day, 365 days in a row for an entire year. That's equivalent to about 2 million people. So this is a devastating disease, not just in the United States, but worldwide. In the United States, we've surpassed 400,000 already in regards to deaths. Yeah, to me, it's shocking. I mean, we have a good friend of ours. I won't mention his name. He's a head of orthopedic surgery in a hospital in LA. Normally, he wouldn't be called on to work in the wards, but they're out of doctors. So as the chairman of the orthopedics department, he's working in the COVID unit. And as you know, he told us that his biggest problem is finding enough body bags. People are dying so fast, they don't have enough body bags or morgue for these deaths. I mean, it's so sad. And he says he leaves the hospital, and he can't believe that people are not wearing masks. People are not distancing. People are still going inside of restaurants. This is a real disease. We're not making this disease up. God, I wish we would or we would have made it up. But it's unfortunately a real disease with real number of deaths and real suffering. And we all need to work on this. We need to get our economy back. We need to get the kids back to school. We need to make everybody safe. The way to do that, we're not going to get the vaccines for a while. And even if we do, we're not going to be safe for a while. So let's mask up. Come on, just man up, mask up. Keep your distance. Just follow those things. Those things are going to help save us. Alan, what are your thoughts? All right, well, let's go back a little bit into the vaccines, where we are. Some data. We have 77 vaccine candidates. We have 200 ongoing clinical trials. We have eight approved vaccines. So it's not that we haven't gone anywhere. Scientifically, we've got quite a long ways. We have phase one studies, which are early studies. We have 24 vaccines. Phase two, 34 vaccines. Phase three, which is getting down the road, 19 vaccines. And eight vaccines that have been approved in at least one country. I'm not saying they're approved in the United States. We only have two approved in the United States right now, BioNTech, Pfizer's and Moderna, which are both messenger RNA type vaccines. Pretty soon, we're going to be seeing, hopefully, the Johnson & Johnson, Janssen Pharmaceutical ones with data coming out later this month. We have the Russian one, which is Sputnik, which is approved in eight countries. AstraZeneca is approved right now in seven countries, the last time I checked. India, Covishield is approved in one country. And Covaxin is approved in one country with five trials in the country. Let's talk about Moderna and Pfizer. Both of us elected to take the vaccine. Luckily, being medical workers, we were offered the vaccine relatively early in the year. Why did you take it? Why do you think it's safe? I think it's perfectly safe. Yeah. I mean, nothing in life is 100% safe. Have people had problems with this? Yeah. I mean, have there been some allergic reactions, not necessarily to the messenger RNA, but possibly the carrier molecules, which is polyethylene glycol and other things put into this? Possibly the gloves even that the healthcare worker was wearing. There may not be latex in the vaccine, but maybe they wore latex gloves and people had allergic reactions to those. But is there a potential of allergic reactions? Yes, very slight. I mean, but nothing is without risk. And we tell people after the vaccine, please wait around for 15 to 20 minutes after you're vaccinated. I elected because right now we've had a significant amount, millions of vaccines administered of both of these, BioNTech, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccine. The data has looked good. Is it 100% protective? Absolutely not. Well, let's talk about safety first. I think it's that from the data we know so far, from millions of people who've received this vaccine, it appears to be safe. Now, a lot of people are afraid of it. I think I hear people telling me they're afraid of it because it's genetically modified vaccine. Can you explain why that's still safe? Okay. Well, one, it's not a, you're not making, we're not giving you actually a vaccine. We're giving you information so you can make the vaccine. So it's quite different than anything we've used before. What RNA is, this messenger RNA is, it's injected into your muscle in your arm. It gets into the cytoplasm, this tissue around this stuff around the nucleus in the cell. And it tells that area, okay, let's make this protein. In this case, it's giving information to make a spike protein, same thing that's on the outside of the virus. So you're making the vaccine by making these spike proteins, which are released out of the cytoplasm. And these dendritic cells or these cells around there then react to those spike proteins and you're making antibodies and your whole immune system is getting revved up to respond to those. It may take two weeks for a good response to that. So this is not something that's made in a fetus, not these. These are- Right. They're not from fetal tissue. They have nothing to do with fetal tissue. And the Pope is electing to get the vaccine also. So I would think he's a much higher authority than I am. But these are vaccines that we have good evidence in regards to safety. Right. The vaccine does not go into your cell. It does not change your genetic material. It's mRNA. I'm sorry, it does go into the cell. It does not go into the nucleus of the cell, which is where the genetic material is. And it's also broken down very quickly in the body. Isn't that correct? Yeah. I mean, the breakdown of messenger RNA is very, very quick. Sometimes within hours, I'd be shocked if there's any residual messenger RNA after a week. But usually we're talking about hours to a day. The reason that is, is your body needs the RNA, needs to push other things into that cytoplasm to make other stuff. So it's not going to stay there. It's not going to continue to make spike proteins. We don't expect long-term sequela. And this is a fascinating approach to vaccine development. This can be used for modifying this as we get more variants. As we have a variant right now that's quite contagious, the B.1.1.7. And we're going to have other variants. We have the Columbus variant right now in the United States. And we have the South African variant. But using messenger RNA, we can modify these and say, okay, make these different type of spike proteins, which are on these different variants. Yeah, I personally think that this technique is a modern-day medical miracle. I think it's a brilliant idea that came just at the right time for us. I mean, that's my feeling. You know, you're right. It's been around for a while. And people have used this or started to use this, but not in clinical situations up until this. So, you know, the reason we get two shots, and let me go to that for a second. Just take measles, mumps, and rubella, which we're all, we give it to babies around the world to prevent, you know, all these childhood illnesses and deadly infections. And after one dose, about 40% of those patients are protected from all three viruses compared to about 4% that, you know, are not protected after their second dose. So the second dose, the booster dose, is quite important. The booster dose, it activates two important types of white blood cells, you know, these B cells, which make your antibodies. But those can be kind of short-lived. And then you have these T cells, which are, you know, they identify particular pathogens or things that are bad for us. And these memory T cells are able to linger in our body for decades. And when, you know, this bad thing gets into our body again, like COVID-19, hopefully they're going to tune up the immune system and allow us to fight that off. So the booster is extremely important. How should you act after you had your first shot? Don't pretend like you're immune. So some studies show over 50% decrease in infections. That doesn't mean you're not infectious. Clinical infections we're talking about. It doesn't mean you couldn't pass it on to somebody else. And that's two weeks after your first injection. Some other studies show, especially in older patients over the age of 60, we're dealing in the 30-s
