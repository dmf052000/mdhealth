How important is protein in your diet?
Episode: 102

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Wayne Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine and wellness. I myself am board certified in internal medicine, and I have with me a world-famous gastroenterologist and expert on wellness, Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie, let's talk about getting protein when you're on a vegetarian diet. Also, making sure that you get some other, you know, what other vitamins do we need to check that sometimes aren't provided by a vegetarian diet. But let's start with protein. Tell me about that. You know, it's a good question. I mean, being a vegetarian person, I understand that. And, you know, a lot of us have heard about the term of complete proteins or high-quality proteins. And some of the people say when you're a vegetarian, there's no way you can get enough complete proteins or high-quality proteins. So let's talk about what a complete protein or high-quality protein is. And, you know, if you make protein, they're built up of amino acids. Amino acids are kind of the blocks that build the protein. So we need these amino acids to make these complete proteins. And these proteins in our body, they act as all the things that are important, the hormones, the enzymes, our body mass, our muscles. And the body can make a lot of these amino acids itself. But nine of them, nine amino acids cannot be made by a human being. They have to be consumed through food. So these nine amino acids we call essential amino acids. So a complete protein has all of the nine essential amino acids that we can't make in adequate amounts. So we call those high-quality protein foods. Incomplete proteins are missing one, maybe two, maybe three of these essential amino acids and are typically, you know, they're plant foods. And incomplete proteins are fine as long as you consume them with other plants that have the amino acids that you're missing. So, you know, in conjunction, you can have two foods that have incomplete proteins and end up being very easy for you to make complete proteins. So just to give you an idea of some of the things that are high-quality proteins, you know, everybody thinks of meat as the go-to. But things like eggs, although some vegetarians will not eat eggs, lacto-ovo vegetarians would. But, you know, the egg whites, we're talking about complete proteins. Soy or edamame or a glass of soy milk or soy pressed into tofu is a high-quality protein, a complete protein. And you can get it in a variety of ways. You can get burgers with soy, vegetarian burgers. You can get, you know, soy milk. You can have edamame, which I eat quite profusely. Pistachios. You know, pistachios actually contain all the essential amino acids that one needs to make proteins. But, you know, quinoa and buckwheat, again, ways to doing that. If one is not a complete vegetarian, is a pescatarian, fish is an excellent source of lean, high-quality protein. You know, we consider salmon as a fatty fish, but that salmon has the fats that really are cardiovascularly protective and good for the brain also. So, you know, those are some easy sources. We know that data says you don't have to be a strict vegetarian to reap the benefits. And this was some data published three years ago. And what we look at people that eat predominantly plant-based diets, if we look at the countries that live the longest, they have predominantly plant-based diets. And the populations that live the longest, you know, the Costa Ricans, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Okinawans, all have predominantly plant-based diets. The majority of their diet is plant-based. But, you know, we already know that diets that emphasize plant-based foods over animal-based foods can decrease the risk of obesity, can decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, you know, we have data from the Rotterdam study and other studies that showed having predominantly plant-based diets are really important. So what other kinds of foods, you know, what other vegetables have protein? Things as simple as watercress has protein. Alfalfa sprouts has protein. Spinach, which a lot of us consume every day, it's a very nutrient-dense leafy green vegetable and has protein in it. There's 0.7 grams of protein in 25 grams of raw spinach. And I probably eat 100 grams of raw spinach per day. Cabbage, which, you know, is very easy to consume, you know, has over a gram of protein. Bok choy has protein. Asparagus has protein. You know, a lot of the foods that we think of, collard greens that we eat every day do have protein. One of the ones I like the best is broccoli. And broccoli, you know, protein does have the essential amino acids. And broccoli has 2.5 grams of protein. So not only is it dense in fiber, it has a lot of the compounds of flavonoids that we want to keep ourselves healthy. But like mustard greens and other ones, it's very good. I mean, Brussels sprouts, another one, is a good source of fiber, which we always talk about in keeping your microbiome healthy. And cauliflower, you know, 2 grams of cauliflower per serving. So, I mean, there's other foods that one can get to get complete protein. C10, it's a popular protein source for many vegetarians. It's made from gluten, and some people can't tolerate gluten, but it's less than 1 per 100. And it can be made into a variety of foods. And it's very dense in protein. One serving of that can have about 25 grams of protein in it. And I mentioned tofu and tempeh and things like that. But lentils and beans, great sources of protein, easy to add. Nuts, you know, great sources of protein. You know, even hemp seeds and other seeds, you know, think about adding those to your diet. So there's a variety of things that you can do to get complete proteins. If you're taking two, you know, two different foods and you mix your vegetables together and you have some whole grain breads and other things, things with sprouted whole grains and legumes, you're going to end up with complete proteins. So it's not that difficult. I gave you some foods that are complete proteins, that have complete proteins with all the essential amino acids. But you don't have to consume all those at one time. If you take a couple foods that have incomplete, missing a few essential amino acids and combine them with a variety of different foods, you're going to end up with complete proteins. And think of oats. I mean, it's one of the things I start every single morning with is oats and oatmeal. And one half cup serving is about five grams of protein. If you're going to eat rice, eat wild rice, brown rice, chia seeds, which I add every single day to my oatmeal, it has about 10 grams per serving of protein, fiber, I mean. And it's also dense in protein. So and then nuts, you know, everybody knows about nuts. You have tremendous benefit of nuts. We've done podcasts on nuts. I think we'll do another one soon because there's a lot more evidence on nuts, the benefits of those. And there's even fruits that do have protein. You know, most fruits generally have lower protein content than vegetables. But the ones that contain the most are ones I often like, blackberries and nectarines and bananas and guava and things like that also have protein. So the bottom line is protein deficiencies among vegetarians and vegans are really, really uncommon. As long as you have a healthy, well-planned diet, you're going to get most or all of the essential proteins, essential amino acids to make complete proteins that you need. Alan, are there any vitamins other than lots of times I hear about vitamin B12 as being a problem with patients who don't eat meat. Is that a problem? It can be. And we have to differentiate in regards to, you know, whether it be a vegetarian who will also take in dairy products, will also eat eggs, or whether it's a vegan. So, you know, if you're, you know, what vitamins essentially can a vegetarian, you know, lack in? And B12 is the most common. So if I have a vegetarian come in, especially a vegan, I do measure B12 measurements in them. Some of the other things that are a little bit more difficult to get inadequate amounts of and they can be measured, you know, calcium a little bit more difficult, but not that I haven't really seen any deficiencies in regards to that, but iron and zinc. So those are things that we can measure. And, you know, those, you know, B12, vitamin D, essentially we're all lacking in for the most part. You know, omega-3 fatty acids, they can be lacking in, but if you tell them what kind of foods, you have alpha-linolenic acid, whether it be flaxseed, chia seeds, and things, they can make those omega-3s. And most vegetarians now add those to their diet. But B12 is created by bacteria found predominantly in animal products such as dairy, meat, and eggs. So a lacto-ovo vegetarian that takes in dairy, that takes in eggs, very, very rarely would be B12 deficient. And, you know, vitamin D deficiency, we see that in almost everybody right now. That really should be one thing that's checked on a regular basis. You know, the other thing, you know, iron can be taken as a supplement, but you don't want to take too much or too little. And you can get non-heme iron in dried beans and legumes and dark leafy green vegetables and dried nuts and seeds and things. So you're right, you know, the predominant
