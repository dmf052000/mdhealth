Can Exercise Be Bad for You?
Episode: 093

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts focused on evidence-based health and wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie has lectured around the world and was the principal investigator in about 1,200 clinical research studies which have been published. Dr. Safdie, let's talk about muscle strength. You were telling me that there's some surprising new information about muscle strength. And also I wanted to ask you, can exercise be bad? Absolutely, I'll answer that in one quick sentence. Yes, exercise can be bad for you if things aren't done appropriately and we'll discuss that. But, you know, we have some interesting information in regards to diet that we really didn't know before. But, you know, let's talk about resistance training. You know, there's three different main exercise or four different types of exercise that we always talk to patients about. You know, aerobic exercise, your walk, your run, your bike. Weight exercise or resistance training, which a small fraction of adults in the United States do the minimum amount of at least two muscle strengthening workouts each week. It's, you know, reported about only 6% of adults in the United States actually do it and do it appropriately. We talked about osteoporosis, but neglecting this resistance training puts you at a higher risk, puts you at a higher risk for balance problems, other things. Balance exercises are another form that, you know, we need to work on, especially as we get older. And then stretching exercises. You know, I'm not saying everybody should look like a weightlifter, but, you know, it's surprising information. And we need to fight back against this muscle loss that we start to see as we get older. And it can be done. But it has to be something that's regular. You know, the bones, the muscles, the ligaments, the tendons, they all work together. And the stronger they are, the better off we are and the less injuries we have. If you're getting stronger and avoid some of this muscle loss, you're going to avoid some of the fractures or some of the actual falls that we have, some of the back pain we have because we get compression fractures, some of the osteoporosis, arthritis, etc. So let's talk about this diet. And you asked me, is there anything new in regards to diet? One of the fascinating things that came out of, and it's not a U.S. study, but it was published in the Journal of Nutrition, that people that consumed a nitrate-rich diet, predominantly from vegetables, not them getting nitrates from bacon and stuff like that, had significantly better muscle function of their lower limb. Poor muscle function, you know, we know is linked to greater falls, greater fractures, and it's a key indicator of general health and well-being. And this was done at Melbourne, and I know you've been there and lectured, Bill, but they looked at, it's a large study, over 3,700 individuals, and over a 12-year period, and they looked at them, they found those with the highest regular consumption of these nitrate-containing vegetables had 11% stronger lower limb strength than those with the lowest intake. And their walking speeds were even better. So it's a fascinating study to optimize muscle function. We propose that a balanced diet should be rich in these green leafy vegetables in combination with your regular exercise, including weight training, which we all go for. So go for the green. You know, leafy greens may be tremendously beneficial, and research, the vegetables that, you know, people ask, well, which ones may be the best? We're not sure which ones are the best, but we found that nitrate-rich vegetables, things like lettuce, which has nitrates in it, spinach, kale, beetroot, you know, all provided great health benefits. And we're not even talking about blood pressure lowering or cardiovascular benefits, which they also have benefits for. So let's, you know, go to, you know, how could exercising be bad for you? Do you have any idea, Bill? How could it be dangerous? Besides you could fall off the bike. Well, I mean, obviously, people who have coronary artery disease that exercise could induce an acute coronary event. I mean, that's the most obvious one, although that's relatively rare. Yeah, I mean, that's extremely rare. It's actually there's studies in gyms and other places and marathons and stuff, and it's lower than the general population. Although if somebody dies in a gym, it gets published much more than if somebody dies in their sleep. But, you know, the benefits of exercise, first and foremost, outweigh any of the risk. Injuries can occur due to poor training, improper gear, poor physical fitness, or even failure to warm up. And they're, you know, they're way too common. If we look at a study that's been published, the prevalence of exercise injuries, 18% of adults reported having an athletic reported injury in, you know, a 12-month period of time. So let's talk about some of the common ones. And, you know, Achilles tendon, very common. This condition occurs in sports that involve a lot of running, rapid starting, you know, and the Achilles tendon can get tight. It's not just the tendon you're stretching, it's the muscles that attach to the tendon. Not wearing the right shoes, not changing your shoes when they're worn out. Too much frequency of that, not cross-training. So if all you do is run and you don't stretch and you don't do anything else, or you run when you have inflammation of the Achilles tendon, where you're already having pain in it, you may end up actually causing significant injury to that. One of the other things that we see, and you see more than I do, is fractures. Sudden impact to any bone can cause a fracture. So you see stress fractures, and you can talk in a second about how common stress fractures are, but broken bones can occur in any sport. We always think of just the contact sports, but we can see those in any sports. We can see them in stress fractures can occur in any of the endurance sports, long distance running. If you're starting getting pain, back off. Other things we see, dislocations. They can present similar to broken bones. And we see those in people that are doing these stopping and starting, football, hockey, basketball type things, even soccer. And it can be in their fingers, it can be in their shoulders, it can be in the knees, the hips. One of the things that both you and I think at some point have had is patellar tendonitis, or what we call jumper's knee. And it's when the tendon connecting to the patella, the tibia, is injured or inflamed. One of the things I don't do is back off, and I do now, but when I was younger, I didn't. If it starts hurting, find another exercise to do. And the primary symptom is knee pain, usually below the kneecap. So you don't want this to become chronic. It's common in sports with frequent jumping, basketball, things like that. And overweight people have it a little bit more. Yeah, in fact, it's actually the most common orthopedic injury in young people under the age of 30, so-called jumper's knee. And as you mentioned, 20% of jumping sports like basketball or long jumpers develop this. So it's a very, very common injury. As you mentioned, stress fractures occur when you have normal bone, but they're put under excess strain. Like we see it every year. I see it here in Cincinnati when the Wright-Patterson takes on a new 1,000 recruits, Air Force recruits, and they march them, take them out for like a 15-mile to 20-mile marches. And then these young guys will develop a stress fracture in their foot. That's probably the most common thing I see. But in joggers, they develop most time the stress fractures in the tibia. And they'll get tibial pain or starts out as so-called shin splints, which are kind of micro stress fractures. And then the shin splints become larger and become actual stress fractures. And if they don't stop running, we had a woman who was kind of addicted to running. She was a beautiful blonde that was kind of used to all this attention. Then when she got older, she didn't get it. So she started jogging. She got addicted to running, and she developed stress fractures, wouldn't stop until she developed a true fracture and had to be in a long-leg cast for nine months before the fractures healed. So stress fractures are something we all need to be aware of. And just like you said, when you have pain, stop. Your body is telling you something. Yeah, I mean, pain, what we do now when we have pain is we reach for a bottle of something to get rid of the pain, an anti-inflammatory. Anti-inflammatories don't cure anything. They have a lot of side effects, and we've talked about them before, and we'll talk about them, I think, in our next podcast. I think it's time to revisit non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. But say you get a shin splint, which is defined as the front part of your leg, anterior part of the surface of the lower leg, between the knee and ankle somewhere. And this stress injury usually occurs in runners more than anything that I see, some basketball players. And the tendons around the shin become overused and inflamed, results in pain. So we're reaching for a bottle of something so we don't have the pain so we can go out and run. Then we're injuring it more. And, you know, with rest it usually goes away, but with untreated and with continued exercise, you can progress to these significant stress fractures you mentioned before. You know, we see sprains and strains, you know, these
