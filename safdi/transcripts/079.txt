The risk of dietary supplements. Some supplements can be hazardous to your health!
Episode: 079

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine, when health and wellness. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology, and I have with me world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine physician, Dr. Alan Safti. Dr. Safti has been the writer of peer-reviewed articles of more than 300 articles himself, and the co-author of more than 900 peer-reviewed medical articles. Today, I want to talk about supplements. Alan, as you know, supplements are not covered by the FDA, and some supplements can actually lead to serious problems, such as bleeding. Do you want to tell us a little bit about supplements? Bill, it's a very topical issue right now because we see more and more patients presenting to the offices and to the hospital taking a tremendous amount of supplements, thinking that they're going to cure and treat different diseases. And everybody has to realize that no dietary supplement can fully treat, cure, or prevent cancer or a lot of other diseases. So, you know, before we talk about that, you know, let me give you a few supplements that may have some anti-cancer properties and may have some other benefits, such as flax seeds, and I have those again in my oatmeal every single morning. They're sold as, you know, raw seeds. They have to be ground. But, you know, there's some evidence, some MD Anderson, that people consuming 25 grams of flax seeds per day may inhibit breast and prostate cancer tumor growth. Now, is that because they're eating other things in their diet? That's why this research is so difficult. So I eat a lot of flax seeds, and I may have a lower incidence of cancer, but is that because I eat flax seeds or the rest of my diet because I eat flax seeds is also tremendously healthy? So it's very difficult to divorce one agent into a diet. Same thing as garlic. I consume garlic in my diet, so does my wife. It keeps us well apart at night. But, you know, there's lots of authors that have pointed out that, you know, garlic may be beneficial. It may also have some risk. But, you know, again, certain agents out there may have some benefit. Curcumin, and we've talked about turmeric in a long time. It's the active ingredient in curcuma longa plant, and it's found in the spice turmeric. And, you know, over the past 20 years, curcumin has received plenty of attention as an anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer drug, antioxidant drug. You know, the mechanism of action of that is that curcumin exhibits its unique anti-cancer activity, stopping the, you know, cells, what we call apoptosis, you know, and inhibits proliferation of these cells. So, you know, there are supplements out there that have benefits, and we've talked about vitamin D. Again, it's a vitamin supplement, and we've talked about how many people are deficient in vitamin D. So too much is bad and too little is bad of vitamin D. You know, supplement safety, you know, we always think that they're harmless. You know, Bill, you know, if you see these, you know, you're thinking, well, these things are absolutely harmless. You know, we see St. John's Wort that everybody says is a popular supplement for depression, anxiety. But as you said before, it can cause problems if you're on certain drugs, from heart medications to antidepressants, even blocking some effects of birth control. One of the things we see all the time is people taking kava, but we've seen liver damage from that. You know, what we call hepatitis. Hepatitis, itis on the end of medical terms means inflammation. So inflammation of the hep or liver. So this kava can cause that. So if you have pre-existing liver or kidney problems, maybe it's going to be dangerous for you. So, you know, we've seen even ginkgo. Everybody's looking for this magic thing to improve memory. And some people believe ginkgo biloba may help with circulation and mental function, even altitude sickness. But it also can thin your blood out. So if you already have a bleeding abnormality, if you have ulcers, if you're on blood thinners, you know, make sure that these things have actual physiologic properties. Discuss them with your doctors before you start on these. Even ginger, which, you know, we recommend often for nausea and even after chemotherapy. And turmeric and ginger are very similar. Same class of root that we use. But again, can cause problems with blood clotting, can cause some digestive issues in some people. So be aware that some of these things can have significant negative side effects. Then we get into things called, you know, nootropics or the basic smart drugs, things that enhance your cognition. Have you ever taken any of these, Bill? No, I haven't. Maybe that's why I'm not smart. Well, maybe it's why you are. You know, the question is, you know, a lot of these supplements contain some B vitamins, contain some fish oil, contain some herbs. But, you know, one review of four randomized controls found that, you know, they may not be that beneficial. They didn't slow, even vitamin B supplementation didn't slow cognitive decline in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. And fish oil supplements have earned similarity and very underwhelming results, not overwhelming results. Previgent, which you can't go 10 minutes without hearing an ad for Previgent. In my opinion, they've made some very bold marketing claims. And it was a self-sponsored study. But Bill, at the beginning of our podcast, say we believe in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals. And, you know, the Previgent data was not double-blind, placebo-controlled, or published in a peer-reviewed journal. So it's really, you know, even another journal took exception to the results that they published in their own study. The human data on this drug in Previgent are limited to small and company-sponsored trials, do not meet expected scientific standards. So we don't have a lot of, you know, the takeaway is be very careful with what you're taking. Some of these have some significant downside risks. And certain supplements can have increased risk for cancer. So there are certain things that may even have increased risk. But discuss any supplement that you're taking with your physician. There's, you know, supplements are not risk-free. There's more than 6,000 reports of serious adverse events with dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbs. And those are just the reported events that we see. Yeah, and I think you've got to talk about megadoses too. A lot of times people will be taking 25 or 30 times, there's no recommended dose, but suggested dose. They'll be taking huge amounts, thinking that if one pill is good, 10 pills is better, and 20 pills is a lot better. That's something I think that we need to address too. I saw a patient nearly bleed out from a bleeding disorder, and there was a normal individual just from ginkgo. And unfortunately, the patient also bled into a spinal cord and became paralyzed. Those medicines, those drugs are not without harm. And I'm talking about serious harm. So keep that in mind. Unless your healthcare provider tells you that you need more than 100% of the recommended daily allowance of a particular nutrient, you probably don't. It doesn't make sense to take huge doses of vitamins and minerals unless there's a diagnosed problem. A lot of people have to take more than the RDA for vitamin D, but that should be under a doctor's guidance. And there's very little evidence that taking megadoses will have more benefits than harm, as you just said. Megadoses of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K definitely can cause problems, may interfere with certain prescription drugs, but definitely can cause significant problems. So too little of anything is bad. Too much is also bad. Too little water is bad. You can kill yourself by having too much water, causing hyponatremia and a very low blood sodium. But too little water is also bad. Too much vitamin D is bad. Too little vitamin D is bad. So unless your doctor tells you that you need more than 100% of the recommended daily intake of a particular nutrient, don't do that until you discuss it with them. And really, one thing, you can't depend on warning labels because they don't really have to have warning labels. Supplement makers can provide warning labels if they want to, but they often don't have warning labels on theirs, and none have been proven to cure major diseases that we know of. So be very careful in what you're taking. Prevention of heart disease and cancer, most of these are unproven. So be very, very careful when you use, and some of these can irritate the esophagus, can irritate your gastrointestinal tract, cause abnormal bleeding, interfere with your normal prescription medicines, and you may not need supplements at all other than potentially vitamin D. Alan, that's a great discussion. Again, buyer beware. Beware, buyer beware. Advice from hundreds of years ago, but still critically important advice. If you liked our podcast, please subscribe. Please tell your friends about our evidence-based medicine podcast. Alan, do you have any final comments? No, just remember your nutrients should come from whole foods, not from a bottle. We get our nutrients by combining all the beneficial phytochemicals we get from a whole food, not from a single nutrient that you find in a bottle in a drugstore. So we can't reproduce the benefits of a blueberry, an apple, or broccoli by taking just a supplement. Sounds great, Alan. Again, thank you for another super podcast. Thank you, Bill.
