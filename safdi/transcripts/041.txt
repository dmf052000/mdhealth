How far away is safe? Covid-19 Update

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. I'm joined here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine doctor, for what we think is the best podcast in all of medicine. Today we're going to talk about questions on COVID-19 from our audience. Alan, I'd like to ask you, what distance should we keep? Here's a question from one of our listeners. What distance should we keep from people that are walking, biking, or running in front of us as we walk to the park or down a sidewalk? Well, Bill, that's an excellent question. First of all, I think everybody has to be cognizant of everybody else that's around. We have to be looking, which we didn't in the past. We had to look behind us, on the sides of us, and in front of us. If a runner's coming, it's an obligation for either the runner to move or the walkers to move. Same thing, biking. In a lot of countries, walking, biking, jogging, they're really welcome activities in the time of COVID-19. But it's important to note that you need to avoid each other's slipstream. What do I mean by slipstream? These particles or saliva particles that come out while the person is moving, and what they do is they go behind us. So if I'm running hard and it's exhaling hard, I have these little droplets, this cloud of droplets called the slipstream that's going behind me. So this poor person that's pretty close behind me is going to be inhaling those droplets. So the typical distance we talk about in most countries, and you're more careful as well as I am, is about one to two meters, usually two meters. And it seems to be effective when you're standing still inside or even outside with a low wind. But when you're going for a walk, run, or bike ride, you better be more careful, especially if you're following somebody. So the person behind you is in this slipstream. So there's a couple of studies. MIT's done some. There's a study from Belgium and the Netherlands looking at these droplets. And the recommendations from this modeling that they did, especially if somebody sneezes or coughs with bigger force, is increasing the distance. So what you would be looking at appears that social distancing is extremely important, especially in low wind environments. And what we would want ideally, what do you think you would want, Bill, in regards to a walker or a runner or a bicyclist? Well, I guess it's just from what you're saying. I try to stay out of the slipstream directly behind that person. Slipstream is kind of a term that we use in bicycling. When the bicycle's immediately behind another bicycle, we call it slipstreaming. So I try to stay away from that slipstream. But I would think I personally try to stay as far away as I can from other individuals. I try to go on the other side of the street if I see someone coming down the street. I think that's wise. First of all, if you can get farther away, get farther away. We don't have a treatment. If we get a vaccine, it's going to be a long time. I know there's some of the vaccination studies. One here is starting up next week. But even once you get the vaccine, the first vaccine is often not that effective. And then the manufacturing process and everything else takes a long, long time. Some vaccines, such as HIV, AIDS, we still don't have a vaccine. We have medicines to treat it so we can treat the disease, but we don't have a vaccine. So be careful. One of the things we look at for people moving in the same direction in one line, which I will try not to be directly behind somebody, we're talking about four to five meters just walking. So 13, 14, 15, 16 feet, not six feet. For running and slow bicycling, 10 meters, over 30 feet. For hard biking, there's a lot of exhaled droplets coming out. And these modeling, it was 20 meters. So I do do biking now, and I'm at least 20 meters behind the person in front of me. Unfortunately, if somebody's passing me, I actually wear a mask when I'm biking and I hold my breath until they're about 20 meters away from me. So let's be more careful. We all need to take this into account and put it in perspective of these closing of busy parks and busy streets we have. We have to be careful if we're the one running or somebody else is running, but give ourselves safe, sufficient distance and be really careful. But that was a good question from our audience. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Alan. And to the audience, please like our website and give it a five out of five. If you don't think it's worth five out of five, email us and tell us why. Join us again for more questions on COVID-19.
