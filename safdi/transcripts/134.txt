Ultra processed foods…why are they bad for us
Episode: 134

------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, today we're going to talk about ultra-processed foods. I know a lot of people talk about that's why the American diet is so bad for you. Now, Alan, when we were young, they didn't even have ultra-processed foods. My mom went to the grocery frequently, you know, which was more like a farmer's market than what we'd call today, and she cooked everything at home and we weren't exposed to it. Now, as I understand, it's difficult to get away from ultra-processed foods. Could you explain to everyone what are ultra-processed foods? Yeah, you're right, Bill. In the dinosaur age when we grew up, there was very few ways of obtaining ultra-processed foods. But think of all these processed meats that are sitting there in your grocery store and people in sandwiches and lunch places and all these fast food restaurants, which we didn't have, actually. You know, we were talking about that earlier. We didn't really have fast food, nor could we afford it if we did have them. Instant meals, instant noodles, sugary drinks. You know, the largest soft drink, I think, that was even sold back then was six and a half ounces in a glass bottle. So we very rarely drank sugary drinks. We didn't have instant meals, instant soups, frozen meals, highly refined grains didn't exist. You know, we did have pastries and had donuts. But think of donuts, pastries, things that you're taking out of the natural state. And if you pick up a label and you see multiple things added to it, preservatives and other things in regards, you know, pick up that label and you're going to see unhealthy fats, salts, preservatives that have been added to these natural foods. So when we were growing up, a lot of the diseases we're seeing right now were more infrequent. As you can remember, when we were interns many years ago, it was unheard of to have a pediatric diabetic. It was almost unheard of, especially adult onset diabetic. And now it's the most common presentation in the pediatric emergency room. We didn't see diabetes as prevalently. We didn't, Parkinson's disease has gone up. Dementia is going up. Colon cancer in young people is going up. And we'll talk about some of those in subsequent podcasts. But ultra processed foods and people talk about why are we so different than some of these other countries that take in similar amounts of calories. In France, they eat a fair amount of calories, but they don't eat a lot of ultra processed foods. So we really need to think about, you know, getting rid of some of these hidden sugars in our diet and ultra processed foods. Bill, you know, in your mind, what are some of the hidden sugars that are sitting out there? Well, they have a lot of different names on the labels. Maltose, fructose is one that I absolutely stay away from. We'll talk about that later. Stay away from fructose. Check every label. Make sure you're not getting it. It's a poison. Alan, give me a list. There's a whole bunch of them. I know you were telling me the other day about all these different hidden sugars. I mean, they sound natural. They sound healthy. You know, agave, which comes from a plant, but it ends up being basically fructose. Agave nectar is in there. Turbinado sugar. You know, you go get a smoothie. Oh, we're not going to add sugar. We're going to put turbinado in there. Well, it's a turbinado sugar. You know, corn sweetener is pretty obvious. Corn syrups, corn syrup solids, you know, evaporated cane juice we see. It sounds good. Fruit juice concentrate, which basically is fructose. Maltodextrin, long chain sugar, glucose. Raw sugar. Let me just mention fructose briefly. Alan, I know you've testified in front of Congress about how bad fructose is. Fructose is thought to be the main cause of liver disease in the United States right now. Well, it's only metabolized in the liver, unfortunately. And plus, it doesn't suppress your appetite. So we take it in. You know, our central nervous system runs off glucose and certain other things, but not off fructose. It's metabolized in the liver. So, you know, but certain things sound healthy. You know, coconut sugar sure sounds healthier than sugar, but it's not. Sorghum sounds healthier than sugar. And then some of them are, you know, the hidden sugars, molasses, palm sugar. You know, it's kind of a hidden sugar that's sitting in there. So read labels. When you start seeing a whole bunch of ingredients, just start thinking ultra-processed foods. Right. Avoid sugars as much as you can, especially sugary drinks. Well, let's talk about that. We've just alluded to some of these health problems. What are some of the health problems that have been attached to these ultra-processed foods, which now are the most common foods eaten in America? Yeah, that's a good question. I'm probably going to forget some of the diseases because they're so prevalent. You know, those who consume, there's over 32 diseases we've attributed to ultra-processed foods or health problems. I mean, reclassify that as health problems. Weight gain, obesity, pretty obvious. You know, cardiovascular disease, not so obvious. A variety of... Diabetes, type 2. Yeah, diabetes. A variety of chronic diseases associated with these ultra-processed foods. You know, the people that took in the most ultra-processed foods, they had a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related deaths from a lot of ultra-processed foods. So, you know, do we want to eat those? No. 21% increased deaths from any cause, you know, up to around 48% to 53%. We'll talk about depression and other things, but it had a higher risk of anxiety and mental disorders. And, you know, the type 2 diabetes, which we've mentioned previously. So these ultra-processed foods are things that we need to extract from our diet. They're things that, you know, we don't eat anymore. And we're very careful in that. But you can get carryout. It's not ultra-processed, but it takes some work. If I go to a Chinese restaurant, I order everything in a bamboo steamer, and these sauces are put on the side. So it's basically steamed vegetables in there. So you can get brown rice. You can get other things in the Chinese restaurant. Yeah, there's a few cereals that are not ultra-processed, like shredded wheat. And for drinks, you can drink soft drinks. Not soft drinks. You can drink fruit juices. Well, I wouldn't. Honestly, I wouldn't even drink fruit juices. You know, because they're, you know, very sugary drinks. If you had a little bit, that's fine. But one of the things when you're eating ultra-processed foods is you are actually not eating the flavanol-rich foods. You know, the foods that you should be eating, which are the natural compounds present in plants, like fruits and vegetables and tea leaves and, you know, even coffee beans. And these diets are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from a lot of chronic diseases. So what we're doing is we're eating an unhealthy diet and we're avoiding a lot of the flavanol-based foods that we should be consuming. Great, Alan. Our next talk, we're going to talk about these processed foods and these causes that cause inflammatory problems, including dementia. So please stay tuned. Thanks, Bill.
