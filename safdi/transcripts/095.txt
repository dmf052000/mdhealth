Blueberries- the fruit of life? Benefits and Downsides
Episode: 095

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm honored to moderate a series of podcasts focused on evidence-based medicine and health with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie has lectured around the world and was a principal investigator at about 300 clinical research studies. Dr. Safdie, we've been talking about nutrition. Let's talk about blueberries today and their values and if there's any downsides to taking blueberries. I know you eat blueberries every day. Can you tell me why? Well, Bill, every year that goes by, there's more reasons that I'm happy that I've incorporated that into my diet for almost my entire adult life. You know, many years ago, and this is just a teaser, we understood that berries, could they be better even than statins? And blueberries and strawberries and cherries and all those bright colored pigments, same thing that's in a plum, red, blue, or purple pigments, have things called anthocyanins in it. And so there was an older study of 93,600 women who were 25 to 42 years of age, and it's called the Nurses' Health Study. And looking at just their diet, not anything else, after 18 years, the risk of heart attacks in those who got the most anthocyanins from their food, about 25 milligrams a day of anthocyanin, was about a third lower, 32% lower than the risk of ones who only got 2.5 milligrams per day. That's hardly any blueberries. It'd be a lot more in strawberries. It doesn't have as deep and dark pigments, but raspberries have these, plums have over 35 milligrams in one plum. That's a tremendous benefit. You go see the doctor and we talk about statins, but we don't talk about anthocyanins, which has some of the best data out there. So, you know, going back, blueberries, you know, they have a wide array of health benefits. You know, they're a tremendous source. We all know that oranges are a great source of vitamin C and bananas are a source of potassium. But blueberries can help us reduce the risk of heart disease, help potentially lower your blood pressure, may fight against, you know, abnormal bacteria in your gastrointestinal tract or potentially even cancer. So, you know, there's tremendous, tremendous benefits to these blueberries, including brain health. So do you eat them every day, Bill? I eat a, I try to eat 10 blueberries a day. I just put it in my diet because I've read such good things about the antioxidant effect. And plus I like blueberries. So if I'm eating cereal, I'll throw them on some cereal, you know. I've even put them on sandwiches before. They're pretty tasty. And I put them in salad at night too. Yeah, I think people will learn to incorporate them. And it doesn't, right, you're correct. You know, if we look at the amount of anthocyanins in a cup of blueberries, remember I'm talking about for at least the cardiovascular benefits, 25 milligrams per day. One cup of blueberries has 530 milligrams. So it doesn't take many blueberries. Now, strawberries, it takes a whole cup, 35 milligrams for a whole cup. Blackberries, again, very dense, 355 milligrams per cup. Cherries, very dense, 175 milligrams per cup. And red grapes has 45 milligrams per cup. And it's very easy to eat 45 milligrams of red grapes. But it's something incorporating in their diet may have tremendous benefits. And benefits we're still studying. You know, it has such a high level of these anthocyanins or phytochemicals that they may even decrease the risk of several cancers by protecting yourselves from chronic inflammation. Phytochemicals can slow the growth rate of cancer cells. And not only that, but maybe we're all producing cancer cells all the time, but trigger, you know, help trigger damaged cells to be destroyed before they can reproduce. So, you know, it's a tremendous benefit that we're going through. You know, the heart health, even if it's not a third, say it's 12 or 15 percent, tremendous benefit to just having that handful of blueberries that you're going to have every day. Cognitive performance. And let's talk, you know, it's hard for you on your own to decide, hey, did my blueberries help me think better? So we have several studies. We have research done at the University of Cincinnati taking blueberries and putting them into a powder and comparing them to placebo. So you have to have a placebo group. So you freeze dry the blueberry powder and you give that to half the people and then placebo powder that looks like blueberry powder and you give it to them for 16 weeks. And those that had the blueberry powder showed improvement in cognitive performance and brain function after 16 weeks compared to the ones that got the placebo. You know, and there's other studies. There was a second study involving 94 people between the ages 62 and 80. And again, it suggested that the people that entered that study that actually got the blueberry powder had better cognition than individuals who took placebo. So tremendous, tremendous benefits potentially to having those. I mean, you take them because you're liking it now, right, Bill? Right. I like blueberries. Plus, they're supposed to be good for you. Yeah, I mean, it's going to improve your gut health. It has fiber, you know, all of these things. You know, if we look at Mediterranean diets where the people that live the longest, they have bright colors. They have all those things within their diet. They're low in calories, but dense and dense in nutrients. So, you know, they have fiber, four grams in a cup. So a fair amount of fiber to help your microbiome. They're one of the most studied antioxidant type foods that we have. You know, every year there's another superfood that comes out, but these may be some of the best. It may help you against cellular aging as well as protect against certain cancers. You know, blueberries and blueberry juice may reduce this DNA damage, which is a leading driver of aging and cancer. The fiber in there, you know, may be beneficial also, but it may help in regards to the oxidative damage. It's, you know, not limited to your cells and DNA. It may help in regards to your lip. The antioxidants, blueberries have been shown to reduce a predominant risk factor for heart disease by preventing oxidative damage to this bad cholesterol, what we talked about, this LDL cholesterol. So, you know, we have effects on blood pressure. We have effects on heart disease. We have benefits for memory function, which are good, well-done studies. And, you know, may delay this mental aging that occurs in people. So I think that it's something incorporated into our diet on a regular basis would be extremely beneficial. And the study done at the University of Cincinnati, you know, we're both in Cincinnati, really not only in the nurse health study, but the Cincinnati studies showing these flavonoids called anthocyanins not only improved animals' cognition, but these were the first really well-done human studies showing real benefit in improving memory and cognitive function in older adults. So incorporating them into your diet. Are there any downsides to taking blueberries? Yeah, you know, remember they have four grams of fiber per cup. So if you take in a bunch of cups of blueberries and have a relatively high fiber diet, you may get too much gas. You may have some bloating in regards to that. But other than that, there really aren't any tremendous downsides. We don't know of a toxicity level. And so it's one of the things that we don't see many downsides, but we see benefit in producing, you know, heart health, brain health, and numerous other aspects of body health in just a fruit. So it is one thing that other than gas and too much fiber, which is usually not a problem in the United States because most people don't consume too much fiber. So, and most people aren't going to consume three or four cups of blueberries in a day, although I will if I can get some really fresh blueberries consumed quite a bit in a day. Yeah, my kids really love them. They really love blueberry pies. And we go up to Michigan every year in July and pick blueberries. And we usually bring back like five or six liters of blueberries and freeze them and use them all year round. And remember that, you know, I'm glad you brought up frozen. You know, it's hard depending upon where you live to get fresh blueberries all the time, but you're not going to lose the anthocyanins and these phytochemicals if you buy frozen blueberries. And sometimes they taste even better because they're picked at the peak of freshness and flash frozen. So it is something to consider that, you know, if you can't get fresh ones, you know, buy frozen ones. And let's say over half the year I buy frozen ones. One, they're less expensive and they're going to protect your heart, your gut microbiome and everything else just as well as the fresh ones. And remember the ones we gave to the people for brain health were actually a blueberry powder because he took the blueberries and freeze dried them and then put them in within capsules. So you may even have healthier bowels, Bill, with all that fiber in there. It all sounds good to me. Alan, again, another great discussion on evidence-based medicine.

I know you're planning on talking about nuts, about the plant-based omega-3 foods, anti-inflammatory foods, and more on brain health. So I'm looking forward to more of these great podcasts. Thank you, Bill, and have a good day. And
