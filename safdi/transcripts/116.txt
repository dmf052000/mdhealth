What food not to eat
Episode: 116

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Dr. William Renner, and it's my pleasure to host this series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. I'm the Emeritus Director of Radiology at the Ohio GI and Liver Institute. Dr. Alan Safdie is Chief Medical Officer of Quadrant Health, owned by Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Safdie served as Chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Gastroenterology at the Deaconess Hospital and Ohio GI Liver Institute and has been elected President of the Ohio Gastroenterology Society. Dr. Safdie has been the primary investigator in more than 200 medical studies and co-investigator in more than 800 studies. Now, Alan, we've talked about foods you should eat. What foods should you not eat? We shouldn't eat a lot of what people do eat. Ultra-processed foods, such as carbonated drinks, processed meats, sweet or savory packaged snacks, is associated with really accelerated biological aging. Our body, our brain, as well as biomarkers. We can look at different biomarkers in people's blood and find that when we take in poor nutritional valued products, we have more dangers to our entire body. So you're saying get fresh meat if you're going to eat meat, get fresh fish, get vegetables. Which vegetables are the most important for us? As we mentioned previously, there's not a vegetable. Yes, we want a plant-based, predominantly plant-based diet. You don't have to be a vegetarian. I have been for decades, but there's no necessity for people to be a vegetarian. But as you mentioned, we want bright colored fruits and vegetables. We want legumes in it. We want healthy oils in our diet. We want to avoid, if you pick up a package, Bill, and it takes you more than 10 seconds to read the ingredients, it's probably ultra-processed. We want to avoid red meat, especially that's not free range, meaning not grass finished, which means they fed them some grass right before they killed them. We want to avoid butter and stick margarine in significant quantities. We want to avoid significant cheeses. Pastries and sweets and fried foods and fast food, almost every fast food place you're going to go to, not all, do have ultra-processed foods, even some breakfast cereals are ultra-processed foods. They have a lot of added sugars and other ingredients. Let me ask you about organic, because I go to the grocery and some things are organic, they cost sometimes three to four times more. Which organic foods are worth buying or important to buy? That's about a 10-minute conversation, but in regards to meats and things, look at free range, whether it be chicken, whether it be beef. They're not truly organic because it doesn't fit an organic definition. In regards to fruits and vegetables, is it important to get an organic banana, in my opinion, no. It might not be worth the money, but in regards to blueberries and strawberries and things that have high pesticide concentrations on them, and pesticides is going to be the new smoking, we're going to talk about that in a bit on another podcast, but try to get those things. If you could buy all organic and the money is no object, I would buy all organic, but when you get into fruits and vegetables that have high contents of spray on them and everybody should be looking at the dirty dozen, it's published every year, and not just the 12, but look beyond that 12. So always reference the dirty dozen list and make sure you buy those as organic. Is there a way to wash the vegetables to make them safer? You know, I do that because sometimes I'm at the gym and they give away free apples and being cheap as I am, I grab one of the free apples. So I take a hand soap that doesn't have any perfumes or other things in it that they happen to have there and I wash the outside of it where most of the pesticides reside, but not all. So I'm not completely reducing it. So washing your fruits and vegetables does decrease the concentration, but not to the point we would like, especially in things that are hard to wash, like a strawberry. You can't really scrub a strawberry. I can scrub the skin of my apple fairly well. But if I have the chance, I'll buy an organic apple. If I don't, I'd rather see you consume the apple, even with some pesticides on it, than avoid those fruits, those bright colored fruits and vegetables. And most of the phytochemicals that are beneficial for you are in the skin of the apple, not in the meat of the apple. Do not juice your fruits because if you do, go in whatever you were juicing, throw away the juice and eat what you were going to throw away because it's the skin of these fruits and vegetables that are beneficial. Thank you, Alan. I'm looking forward to your next podcast.
