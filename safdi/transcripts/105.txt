Olive Oil: The juice that oils longevity
Episode: 105

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine and wellness. I'm here today with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and well-known international speaker on nutrition and medicine as well as wellness. Dr. Safdie, let's talk about olive oil. I know there's been some interesting talks, interesting articles about olive oil recently. Does olive oil intake make you live longer? Bill, you know, we've been talking about olive oil for years. I remember lecturing a decade ago on olive oil because of the Mediterranean diet. But we have some new fascinating stuff that was just published recently where olive oil intake was tied to reduced mortality or death rates. But let's go back a little bit and talk a little bit about the Mediterranean diet. For our audience, just briefly review what the Mediterranean diet is. You know, that's a good question and a lot of people actually probably don't know. I mean, let's think of the Mediterranean diet pyramid with the largest portion of that pyramid being fruits, vegetables, grains, mostly whole grains, not processed foods, olive oil, beans, nuts, legumes, seeds, herbs, and spices. Kind of the middle of the slightly smaller portion of that pyramid is fish and seafood. And at the top of that pyramid, you know, towards the top, you have poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt. And then at the very top, the smallest portion of the pyramid are sweets and meats. You know, just a tiny portion of their diet. But if we follow 1.5 million healthy adults, and this is from years ago, demonstrated that following the Mediterranean diet, we followed them, was associated with a reduced risk of deaths from heart disease and cancer as well as reduced incidence of Parkinson and Alzheimer's. Now we have a study with even larger amount of 90,000 U.S. health care professionals taking a look at that. But we've known in the past that if you just get rid of a lot of the stuff in a typical American diet and have a diet high in fruits and vegetables and not processed foods and low in bad dairy products and only very modest portions of lean meat, poultry, and almost no sweets, that your blood pressure did better. Your LDL did better. So a lot of these things we've already known about. You know, the Mediterranean diet really emphasizes eating predominantly plant-based foods, replacing butter with things such as olive oil, and we'll talk about that. Instead of salt, use herbs and spices, limiting that red meat to only a few times per month. And, you know, if you're going to have wine, again, that's fine, but have it in small amounts and moderation. And part of the Mediterranean diet, which is really an integral part, which isn't a diet, is being physically active. Enjoy your meals with family and friends. Those are all important things. But this diet has better outcomes for waist circumference, for high-density lipoprotein, the good portions of cholesterol, lowers triglycerides, helps with blood pressure control, helps with glucose control and metabolic syndrome. Yeah, and part of it, just like you said, is taking a walk. Take a walk before you eat or take a walk after you eat or in the morning after you eat, take a walk. I mean, exercise is a very important part of the Mediterranean diet scheme. Yeah. No, being an active lifestyle, it doesn't mean going to the gym for 30 minutes and the rest of your day is filled with unhealthy habits. Think about unprocessed, these highly processed foods we eat in the United States that have, you know, many ingredients, half of them you can't pronounce, are really not good for you. And we don't see those in the Mediterranean diet. So we're going to talk a little bit about olive oil. But, Bill, what percentage of olive oil do you think is tested in the United States by the Department of Agriculture failed to meet quality standards? 10%, 20% of olive oil? Failed to meet standards. Well, I know a lot of it comes from Europe and some of it's very old, six months, because it's put on ships and it takes three or four months for the ship to get here. So I would say that only about maybe 20% or 30% passes, I would guess. Yeah, that's good. I mean, 69% in the previous study of imports tested failed to meet a U.S. Department of Agriculture quality standard. Imagine a fruit juice and think of olive oil as a fruit juice. Imagine extra virgin olive oil as a freshly squeezed juice. You're not going to leave it open for a long time exposed to light because it will degrade. Yeah, I think that's important that people buy olive oil that has the stamp on it of when it was processed. And several of them from California have that. If you get them from Europe, I don't think they have them, or if you do, remember this thing's been on a boat. They don't put them on a jet plane. The thing's been on a boat, and right now they're sitting out to the sea, half of them, waiting to get off the boat. So even though it seems neat to buy Italian olive oil, you're not dealing with fresh olive oil, I don't think, do you? No, they can be. It depends on – you're right. We have to look at when it was manufactured, what lot it was. But more importantly is write on the bottle when you open it. So if you have a bottle and it's kept in a cool, dark place, not extremely high temperatures, it may not start to degrade. But immediately when it's exposed to oxygen and light, it will slowly start to degrade. So when I open a bottle of olive oil and I go through them very quickly, I write the date that I opened that bottle. You know, oils with the highest level of heart-healthy compounds tend to be more pungent and peppery. If it doesn't taste like anything, it may not even be a very good olive oil to begin with. But let's talk a little bit about these studies. So we looked at 90,000 U.S. health care professionals, and consuming even a small amount of olive oil was associated with reduced mortality. And we're not talking about a lot of olive oil. The amount we consume in the United States is trivial compared to the amount consumed in most countries. Here in this study, those who consumed the greatest amount, which was, you know, half a tablespoon per day, which is not very much. I consume probably five times that a month, had 19% lower mortality risk over 28-year follow-up, starting with an average age of 56. But, you know, we've already known that, you know, we have lots of data that support our current dietary recommendations to increase the intake of olive oil and other unsaturated fats. How much olive oil should you take, or would be a good amount of olive oil to take a day? Well, in this study, and you have to go by studies, I mean, the people in the highest consumption group consumed greater than a half tablespoon per day. I mean, if I put a half a tablespoon on my bread, I'm going to think I didn't put any on my bread. Yeah, I mean, that's a low amount because we tend to do the same thing. We take bread and dip it in olive oil and eat that at night. You have, you know, the highest fiber breads you can get. But we've known that it's not just the olive oil. It's what we're replacing. We're taking these, you know, MUFA or monounsaturated fatty acids and replacing some very bad fats in our diet. And we know that that improves our overall health and longevity. So it's not just, you know, I've mentioned cardiac support and I mentioned other things. One of the things it's hard to control for when you read a study is, you know, the group that took in the most olive oil often tend to be healthier than the average U.S. population. Their body mass index is when I looked at the study constituents, their body mass index was lower. They ate more fruits and vegetables. You know, unfortunately in this study, they didn't distinguish between virgin olive oil, extra virgin olive oil, and refined or processed olive oil. So I would suggest everybody buy extra virgin olive oil rather than virgin olive oil and definitely not refined or processed olive oil because you're degrading, you're getting rid of a lot of those essential, you know, ingredients that are good for us. And during some of these studies, you know, participants had to, you know, respond to questionnaires. So we would find out about salad dressing, baking, frying, sauteing, you know, what you spread on your bread. You know, did you use margarine or butters or what kind of dairy fats did you use? So we have a lot of data on these. So in the next talk, we're going to talk about some of the things, you know, we're spacing this into two different talks because it's such a big topic. Yeah, I would like to hear your thoughts about margarines, butters, you know, olive oil, which oils should we use? Why don't we talk about that in our next talk? And we'll talk about, you know, the deaths that occurred for cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, respiratory diseases, because those are all things that we have data on right now. So, you know, I think it's a good thing. Yeah, that's a great talk. All right, so stay tuned. We're going to have our next discussion continuing on olive oil and other foods such as butter or margarines and what effect they have on our longevity.
