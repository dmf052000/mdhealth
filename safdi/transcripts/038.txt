Testing for Covid-19
Episode: 038

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine doctor, to discuss COVID-19. It's April 14, 2020, and we want to keep you updated. Alan, let's talk about testing. All the experts are saying that we have to do testing before we can return to a normal society. That is, we have to find out who has COVID-19, who can get COVID-19, and who should we quarantine for COVID-19. What are your thoughts on testing? Bill, that's an excellent question. Before we get to testing, one of the things that we've noticed with other coronaviruses, there was a study just recently published in the Journal of Infectious Disease, and they looked at four different coronaviruses over an eight-year period, and they were able to detect some seasonality. So the reason I bring this up, meaning they had from December to, say, May, the most infections. So if this starts to drop off in May and June, we shouldn't think we're out of the woods. We still need to get ahead of this. We've done an abysmal job in regards to getting testing for acute infections, for testing to see who has antibodies against this, to looking at herd immunity. So if we look at these other coronaviruses, and they looked at four different coronaviruses, COVID-19 is one as a type of a coronavirus, the testing is imperative. Looking at those previous ones, there's seasonality, meaning there's certain seasons we're at risk, and we shouldn't think, as some of our politicians will think, that once we start seeing a decrease in these cases, we're out of the woods at all. So your question is great in regards to what about immunity? You know, immunity after some infections can range from a lifetime of immunity, meaning after you get measles, and we both had measles, you know, we're immune for the rest of our life because we had an active measles infection. Sometimes immunity is going to be virtually non-existent. So we need to see who is immune, but first we need to see who has the infection and then do contact tracing. So there's different types of testing. One is that everybody's heard of is that nasopharyngeal swab. So you put a swab up your nose, but it doesn't go just in the last part of the nose. It goes way up in the nose. It feels like it's going into your brain. It's not a comfortable sensation to have a nasopharyngeal swab. And then we're actually looking for the virus. We're looking for active infection. We're looking for, I'm not going to go through how we look at those components to see if there's active virus. But isn't that very inaccurate? I mean, you were saying just the other day there's a 30% false negative. That is, 30% of the people who actually have the infection, if you do the nasal swab, it'll be negative because the patient couldn't tolerate having the swab all the way back in their nasopharynx. Yeah, that's absolutely right. There's a couple reasons it's negative. One is sometimes we're using people that aren't trained in testing. We have patients that won't tolerate the testing. As you said, it's very, very uncomfortable to have that feeling like it's going all the way up into your brain to get that active test. And the other is, you know, how accurate is our testing? We rushed through this. We ignored a lot of the signs that we should have been looking at in January and February and a lot of March, realizing we've got to get ahead of this. And now we're trying to play catch up in regards to that. We don't have enough tests. We need to start testing more of the people that have minimal symptoms. So if I got a cold-type symptomatology right now, could I get tested? No, I really couldn't. Being a physician, I might be able to. But the average person cannot. So we need more of those tests. The test is not available to the public. So we cannot get tested. You have to meet a certain criteria. And I think those vary, but they include fever. And we already know that many of the patients who have COVID-19 don't have fever. Maybe as much as 50% of the patients don't have fever. So we're not going to be testing people that may have COVID. Yeah, and then we miss these super spreaders that are walking around, going into areas, walking in parks and other things, and not really maintaining the distance, which we talked about previously, and spreading this virus. Ideally, we would test everybody. Then we know who has it. Then we do contact tracing on those people. And we can sequester the people that came in contact with for 14 days. We sequester people with infections. And we can get rid of a substantial amount of person-to-person spread of this virus. We don't have the ability, as you said, to do that. So at this point, we need a lot more tests. We've got to test. The really sick person, you know, you're a radiologist. You could look at a CAT scan and see these infiltrates. And I'll ask you, you know, they're somewhat specific for COVID-19. But the people that have minimal symptomatology are the ones that we need to be testing or even no symptomatology. Kids may be walking around with this disease and spreading it, not knowing that they have it. Kids in the neighborhood that we live in are playing together still, even though they're not supposed to be. And there's gatherings of teenagers, unfortunately, at the end of the street. And we see this all the time, and we can have significant spread. So until we can really check more people, it's going to be a problem. So the second type of test. Interestingly, in China, they found that the CT scan was much more sensitive, especially in the first four or five days, than the antibody test. And maybe you could comment on the blood test, because I think that's going to help us when we have those antibody tests available. That'll make a big difference, I think. Yeah, what we want to look at is there's two different type of antibodies. So the first test we talked about where we're doing these swabs is we're looking for active infection. Then we have people that have had the infection, gotten over it, and have some degree of immunity. And again, that immunity question is how long will it last? What degree of antibodies did you get? I've mentioned before, and you know I had hepatitis B vaccine, which is against a different type of virus. I went through a series of three vaccinations, did not get antibodies. After three vaccinations, had an additional three before I developed an antibody response. So it doesn't mean even once we have a vaccine that it's going to be universally effective in this. So we may be dealing with problems all the way up to 2022 with this. So the question of a person being completely immune for life is correct for some infections, but not for other ones. But first we need to know who has those antibodies, who has these IgG antibodies, which are the antibodies that last long periods of time, months, years. We're not sure for this virus how long it's going to be. So Alan, why don't you explain that there's two types of antibodies, and do you want to go over that? Yeah, I mean we have, you know, the first one I'm talking about is IgG antibodies, which are the ones that give us some degree of immunity. You know, much of our understanding of coronavirus immunity comes not from COVID-19, but from SARS and MERS. But those infected a comparatively much smaller group of people, but they caused respiratory infections, and those antibodies could last, you know, a long time, at least a year or longer, we know. So in this we're looking at IgG antibodies to confer some sort of immunity to us. So if we know who's immune, can they go back to work? Yeah, theoretically they could go back to work. How long will those IgG antibodies last? We need to continue to follow them. So we need to know the denominator, how many people in our population have had this disease and gotten over it with minimal symptoms. The other type of antibody you're talking about is IgM antibodies. So when you first get infected, when they do that swab on you and we say, Bill, you have an active COVID-19 infection, I want you home, you know, you're going to be home until symptoms are resolved and a minimum 72 hours after complete resolution. We're going to test you at that point in time because you're a physician to make sure you still couldn't spread it. But the IgM antibodies are the first antibodies that are going to be going up after this infection. So if we could get a blood test, and it could be a drop of blood, the test for IgM and IgG will pick up people that have active infection potentially. The IgM ones goes up within several days after getting the infection, but it may be gone in two weeks. So if you just have IgG positive, you've had the disease, and this is a broad generalization, but you've had the disease and you've gotten over it and you have some degree of immunity. If you have IgM and IgG or IgM alone, IgM alone we would assume you have the disease. IgM, IgG is indeterminate. You may continue to be able to spread virus at that point in time. You may still have an active infection but developing immunity. So once the IgM is gone in a couple-week period of time, hopefully you're getting better and you have those IgG antibodies that are going to give you the immunity that we want. And I understand those tests are somewhat available but not widely available. How
