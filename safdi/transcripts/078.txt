New Years Healthy Resolutions
Episode: 078

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me on this podcast on health and wellness. This is an evidence-based podcast. I'm happy to be here today with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-renowned gastroenterologist and internist. I myself am board-certified in internal medicine and radiology. Today, we're going to talk about the new year and what are some healthy New Year's resolutions. Alan, do you have any ideas on this? Well, yeah. I mean, it's back. The new year's here. Everybody's trying to make goals. A lot of people failed on last year's goals, especially this year. We had the COVID-19 and a lot of people gained weight or didn't stay in as good a shape as they should have. Yeah, I'm speaking for myself. I lost a lot of weight just before COVID, and unfortunately, I think I put some of it back, and I'm certainly not going to the gym as much. I was going to the gym two hours a day. Now, I'm lucky if I can do 10,000 steps a day. So it really does put a little stress on you. It makes it a lot harder to work out. Yeah, I mean, what we're going to be doing is giving you, hopefully, some of my tips for a plan for your resolutions to get healthy. Not just exercise, but to get healthy, eat better, lose weight if you need to lose weight. So basically, let's look at you can't undo a donut by exercising. You can't undo a cookie often by exercising. Some of these may have 300, 400 calories. You're going to have to go out and walk three, four, five miles. So just working out is inadequate. So let's talk about some of my tips. First of all, one of the best diets that we've ever come up with is not a complex diet. It's actually a very healthy diet. It's a Mediterranean type of diet. It could be the new Norwegian diet or Mediterranean diet. I'll explain it to us, but I think that's a really good point because you just made because one Reese cup is about 350 calories. And I could go through a whole box of those pretty quick. So I think that's a really good point. You could out eat your exercise pretty quick. Yeah, it doesn't take much effort to consume more calories than you used up exercising. Exercising is for other reasons. It not necessarily is a means, a sole means of weight reduction because people need to think of the consequences of what you eat. So a Mediterranean diet is essentially, you know, for the most part plant-based. So a lot of whole grains, a lot of fruits, a lot of veggies, a lot of nuts, olive oil. You know, if they eat fish and chicken, it's about twice per week. Almost no red meat in there. And if they consume wine, it's in moderation. So, you know, it's a good start, the Norwegian diet. But whatever you're doing, add more plants, fruits, vegetables to your diet, more nuts, more olive oil, moderation in regards to exercise. I mean, not moderation in regards to, you know, alcohol. Leave time in the morning for mindfulness. You know, start the day out, you know, don't start out rushed. Save time in the morning for a little bit of reflection, a little bit of time. Save time to sit down for a healthy breakfast. And again, this healthy breakfast should again have healthy fats in it. Not necessarily avoiding fats, but the type of fats that we consume should be healthy. And make sure you consume enough water throughout the day. Often we can't differentiate between hunger and thirst. Alan, what do you eat for breakfast? It's a good question, Bill. I mean, I have basically, I'm pretty boring. I've had the same breakfast for many years. I eat breakfast at home, first of all. I avoid reaching for sugar-packed foods. I don't have a sugar-packed energy bar. A lot of energy bars have a tremendous amount of sugar in it. I have steel-cut oatmeal every single day. It's high in fiber. It's very low in sugar. It has no added sugars. It has no simple sugars in it. It's a whole-grained approach. And I add things to jazz it up. I put nuts in it. I put chia seeds. I put cinnamon. Not cinnamon sugar, but cinnamon. And I have blueberries and banana every single day, sometimes strawberries in it. And these antioxidants have been shown to help with heart disease and decrease cancer. You know, the anthocyanins in the blueberries and things are tremendously beneficial. Then I plan out my lunch. As I mentioned before, plan your lunch. Do not eat fast food. You know, we want to avoid the Whoppers and fries. We have to avoid those diet drinks and the sugar-sweetened beverages. So take water with you. Take sparkling water with you, whatever you need. But let's make that a New Year's resolution to avoid those. Let me ask you about the oatmeal. Do you put your oatmeal in the refrigerator the night before or cook it the night before? That's a good question. Steel-cut oats take a little while to cook. So I may cook mine four or five servings in a day, put all four or five bowls in the refrigerator, pull one out the next morning, throw it in the microwave for 45 seconds, and then add my fruit and my chia seeds and my flaxseed and my nuts and my cinnamon and all that to it at that time. Because I really don't have time in the morning to cook it every day. So you can cook up five bowls at a time and just save them. So it's already ready there. The time that you're most rushed is often in the morning. So plan out your day so you have time to plan out when you're going to be doing these things. So that's why I do it then. I plan out my lunch well in advance. I plan to have nuts. I have yogurt. And those are all very healthy. And eat slowly. Make that something. Every time I've traveled to a different country, people in the United States consume food so much faster than almost anybody I've seen. Yeah, we just crank it down. It's like gobbling it down. And so they eat so much faster than everyone else. My sharpened pudding. I mean, you know, we're Americans. Well, wait a good 10 minutes before deciding to have a second plate at dinner. It takes a while for this food. The sense of fullness takes a while. If you remember, you know, there's GLP-1, but I'm not going to get into that. But release of different hormones take a while to get to your brain and tell you're full. If that didn't happen, everybody would stop with their first plate at Thanksgiving. But they stop at their second or third plate and they feel terrible the rest of the night. So if you wait that 10 minutes before deciding to have a second plate, sit there and talk. You know, make it a resolution to carry a bottle of water with you. You know, that's a key point. In other countries, when you have dinner with them, they have small courses. And between courses, there's always a several minute wait. So it gives you a chance for your food to, you know, be processed, I guess, or for you to, you know, your body to process that you've actually eating. So it's a much longer time. In America, it's like we're forced to eat fast. When you go to a restaurant in Europe, you have the table most of the time. You have the table for the whole night. In the United States, you've got the table for 25 minutes and then the waitress wants you to get out of there so they can put the next group in. So I think that's just all part of our bad habits here. Well, make this part of your new resolution. I mean, seriously, folks, write this down. Develop a plan. Don't buy garbage. Don't go to, you know, if you're at work for 10 hours and you're hungry, the first thing you're going to grab is some chips. In my office, I will have nuts. In my little refrigerator, I have sparkling water. I have yogurt that's not sweetened, Greek yogurt, unsweetened Greek yogurt. And I have apples and other fruit that's sitting right there. So just plan out this, you know, designate a time for exercise and be prepared, whether it be at lunch, whether it be when you get home, whether it be in the morning. You know, another resolution that's extremely important, which has been shown for health as well as weight gain, is get at least seven hours of sleep every night and stick to the same sleep schedule, at least on the weekdays. This year especially, have a plan to cope with your stress, whether you have somebody to talk to, walk with. And during your lunchtime, if you have 45 minutes for lunch, take a brief walk. It may not be your exercise, but leave time for those. Be consistent, you know, with everything. And if you have a brief setback, if you go out and you have a terrible dinner, look at your goals that you're writing down after this and learn how to get back on track. If you don't get enough sleep, just assess why and allow for some downtime. You really want to do that. And, you know, all you need for exercise is two legs. You don't need special equipment. You need a good pair of shoes and two legs, and it's going to help with your blood pressure, your cardiovascular fitness, your mental fitness. But set out these goals. Be realistic with exercise. As I told people before, you can have a 31% decrease in all-cause mortality, meaning dying of cardiovascular disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, by just getting about 21 to 22 minutes of exercise every single day.
