How much should you exercise during the Covid-19 Lockdown?

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining us on this podcast on evidence-based medicine. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist, internal medicine doctor, and what we think is the best podcast in all of America, especially in medicine. We're answering questions from our audience on COVID-19. Here's a good one for you, Alan. How much should you exercise during the COVID-19 lockdown? That's a good question. I mean, you know, I live in a neighborhood where I see everybody walking constantly. You know, exercise is important for our mind as well as our body during this. And the typical, the standard recommendations have been, you know, they're simple. Get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week, 70 of really strenuous physical activity. The Copenhagen study, which is a very large one, essentially it equates to about 22 minutes a day, had a 31% decrease in all-cause mortality, meaning strokes, heart attacks, infections, other things. So we do know that exercise is extremely important. Regular exercise increases your body's production of antibodies, helps your T cells, which are going around killing different things in your body that are bad for you. Regular exercise lowers your stress hormones, and everybody knows that we're stressed during this period of time. Even sweating is good for your immune system. So, you know, exercising five days a week, you know, really at least I exercise somewhat every day. I don't really consider taking a walk to be terribly significant exercise. So on my day off, I may walk a long ways. Do you count steps? You know, like my iPhone keeps track of my steps. I try to do like 12,000 steps a day, but I mean, that doesn't actually relate to hard exercise because some of those steps are just walking around the park, and I'm not sure that's, you know, strong enough exercise. Yeah, that's not moderate physical activity. I don't because I think people can become fixated on, I have an Apple Watch. I look at the end of the day, but I don't fixate on, you know, how much. It'd be another stress in my life if I had to say, okay, I want to take 10, 20, or 30,000. I got more steps to do, yeah. So I think it's just important that people think this is part of their lifestyle. It's like eating a healthy diet that we talked about, getting seven to nine hours of sleep a day. You know, exercising, you know, reasonably is very important. But can you exercise too much is, yeah. You know, if you're exercising too much and you start getting loss of appetite or really sore muscles, you're fatigued, not just while you're running, but the rest of the day you're totally fatigued. If you start having injuries, you know, if you're irritable. So, you know, you can exercise to the point you actually weaken your immune system. The Copenhagen study was interesting. You had a 31% decrease in all-cause mortality at essentially 22 minutes a day. If you went all the way from 22 minutes a day to 60 minutes a day, you only gained an extra 8%. So the key is get out and do something. But do you have to kill yourself doing it? Not necessarily. You know, if you exercise too much, are you more susceptible to getting COVID-19? We just don't know. We know people that exercise too much to the point that they're not eating healthy. It changes their immune system. We don't have any studies available in regards to COVID-19 for almost anything in regards to this. But you have to be very careful. You know, we've got so many episodes of this right now. So if you don't exercise, you know, start safely. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you're not used to exercising. You know, start out slow. Build yourself up slow, a little bit per week. And make sure you don't have any of the signs of over-exercising that I mentioned previously. So over-exercise is not good. And not exercising at all is extremely bad. So in each one... Yeah, I think just as you said, I think exercise just helps us keep a good mental attitude. Going outside, being in the sunlight for a little bit, I think is helpful. And I think we all... Yeah, you're right. And it helps, you know, we know that it reduced the risk of upper respiratory infections in other studies on people that exercise. When we compared them to the sedentary individuals. So in the ones that did get infected, they had less severe symptoms. So those exercising had good physical fitness ahead of time. They had 32 to 41% less severe symptoms. So it can mitigate symptomatology because you're enhancing your own antibodies and T-cell function. But over-exercising, when you get irritable, when you lose your appetite, when you're not eating healthy, if you're exercising to purge. So if you had a big meal the day before and you go out and run 80 minutes or 100 minutes because you had a large meal, that's not healthy. We're exercising for all the reasons you just mentioned, Bill, and to improve our immune system and psychologically help and lower our stress hormones. But we're not exercising for those other reasons. Thank you, Alan. That was very, very helpful and insightful. Stay tuned for more questions on COVID-19.
