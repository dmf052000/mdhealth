What is a heart healthy diet?
Episode: 101

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, welcome to this podcast on evidence-based medicine on wellness. I myself am board certified in internal medicine, and it's an honor to be hosting Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and expert on health and wellness, to discuss health and wellness. Today, Alan, let's talk about heart health. What things can we do to keep our heart healthy? You know, Bill, it's a great topic and it's really important. It's one of the things, you know, we have some devastating diseases in this country, but heart disease has been a devastating disease for decades. Each year, almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. And what is a heart attack? You know, when some of your blood that should get to portions of your heart to keep it alive, those blood vessels get blocked. And when those blood vessels get blocked, that part of the heart doesn't get enough oxygen. And actually, that part of the heart can start to die. So we're not going to go into specific ways of unblocking those. We're going to go into ways maybe we can do things that can decrease your risk of getting heart disease. We really want to emphasize, you know, there's tips and things that you can do to decrease the risk of heart disease. We'll get into some surprising things later on. And a lot of these things we've discussed in the past. You know, if you smoke, obviously, quit. You know, don't continue to smoke. Don't be exposed to secondhand smoke. And get rid of some of this stuff that we eat all the time. Some of these chips that have unhealthy fats in them. You know, you could take chips and spice them up with veggies, with salsa, with black beans, with pinto beans. You know, we want to increase the amount of fiber. Some of the evidence that we have right now is our microbiome, the bacteria within us, may help dramatically in regards to improving heart health. The healthier our bacteria in our colon are, the healthier our heart may be. So one way to keep our heart healthier is increase the amount of soluble fiber. You know, increase the apples, the pears, the avocados, the berries, the oats, barley, all those things within our diet. And to get moving. I don't care whether you dance, which I can't. Whether you cycle, which I love to do. Or whether you run. But, you know, get moving. The Copenhagen studies showed that the equivalent of about 21 minutes a day of exercise decreased all-cause mortality. And all-cause mortality, they predominantly looked at strokes, heart attacks, dementia, and cancer by 31%. So a 31% decrease by just doing 21 minutes a day. You know, increase the amount of good healthy fats within our diet. Unfortunately, in the United States, we have predominance of unhealthy fats. So think about omega-3s and monounsaturated fatty acids. You know, omega-3s are the type of thing you'll find in fish, but you can also get alpha-linolenic acid. I'm a vegetarian. You can get it from a variety of plant-based sources. You know, there's evidence in learning to stretch. I mean, I can't stretch as much as I used to, but I try to stretch every evening. I'm not good at yoga, but, you know, consider just some stretching exercises to relieve stress. And start to laugh at situations. It gets harder and harder as we get older. But think about things being funny rather than overly serious. And we discussed in the previous podcast, we are addicted to salt. You know, try not to use added salt. If the entire United States population cuts its average salt intake to a half teaspoon a day, it would significantly cut the number of people with coronary artery disease through hypertension. All right, Alan, give me some good foods and give me some bad foods. I can give you a study, and it's a good question. You don't have to be a vegetarian, so take this with a grain of salt. But this was a study published some time ago. And it's a study in regards to vegetarian diet reduced heart disease risk by 40%. So it doesn't have to be just vegetarian diet. And it's a long list of papers that have been published on many health benefits of reducing meat intake. And it's great news for your heart. So currently in the United States, being a vegetarian, when I started, it was really an anomaly to see a vegetarian. But they're steadily becoming more popular. And plant-based diets have really shown significant benefits. So I'll give you some benefits. For individuals following a plant-based diet or predominantly plant-based diet, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 40%. Coronary heart disease, these blockage of these arteries was reduced by 40%. Blocked arteries get better in some patients. Hypertension risk dropped by 34%. Cholesterol and the bad lipoproteins, what we call LDL. So just remember L is lousy if you want to know which one's bad. Those bad levels of bad cholesterol are lower in vegetarians compared with non-vegetarians. So those are some good foods that one is going to want to consider adding to their diet. And there's some other foods that are kind of surprising. I mean, we're talking about a very prominent disease. 12.1% of the adult population are diagnosed with heart disease, according to CDC. And about almost 7% of outpatient visits involve coronary artery disease or not enough blood supply to the heart. And 7.2% emergency department visits relate to this. So some surprising things are things that have anthocyanins, whether it be strawberries, blueberries, those kind of foods are high in phytochemicals, which may provide some cardiovascular benefits. And there was a trial that was published in a journal of nutrition in regards to that. And they followed them in the primary, putting people on that the primary outcome was changing fasting low density lipoprotein, the lousy cholesterol. And they showed benefit. Their conclusion was strawberries may improve vascular health, independent of weight changes or anything else. Some other foods we forget about are legumes. So whether it be soybeans or chickpeas or lentils or peanuts, they make up 33% of the dietary plant proteins. And we know their health benefits are really well documented. So adding those to your diet. Olive oil instead of butter or margarine. Margarine shouldn't even be in the vocabulary. But olive oil. Olive oils are rich in monounsaturated fat. Olives are rich in monounsaturated fat. Really, when you're eating a whole olive, they have fiber, they have vitamin E, they have various phytochemicals, they have monounsaturated fats. And there was a study that was published, I can't remember exactly when, back in nutritional science. And it looked at the health benefits associated with their consumption. And they think they're predominantly secondary to the monounsaturated fatty acids, but also the antioxidant capabilities of vitamin E and other things within those. So simple things like okra, which we hardly ever eat in the United States. First, it originated in Ethiopia. It was cultivated by the Egyptians somewhere around, I guess, the 12th century. And there was another article. It was published in the phytochemicals in okra and other foods similar to okra. So it doesn't have to necessarily be okra. But all these plant-based foods are really, you know, the bottom line is, you know, research has shown relatively definitively that eating these and other health, not just these, but other heart-healthy foods can be a significant benefit to your cardiovascular health. And there's a variety of foods that are bad for your health. So it's not only understanding what is good for your health, but, you know, what's bad for your health. What's bad? Give us some bads. Some people are going to say, I'm not going to eat the good ones, but tell me what's the bad ones. You know, things like hamburgers. You know, the average American eats more than 200 pounds of red meat and poultry in a single year. So, you know, you may want to cut down somewhat on the red meat. If you are, try to get free-range red meat. Cut down on the sodium within the red meat. Don't be adding salt to those. And it's what you put on it also. You may put some fatty cheeses on it and some other things. Fried foods shouldn't enter your vocabulary. You know, fried chicken, absolutely, you know, no. I mean, take the skin off the chicken. You can have your chicken. Frying deteriorates oils through the process of oxygenation and hydrogenation within the chicken. So not only you're frying it and adding bad fats, but it leads to a loss of the unsaturated fats that normally would be within the chicken meat itself, which is a linoleic acid. So you end up with these trans fats called trans linoleic acid. I know that's more detailed than people want to hear. So if you strike out the hamburgers and the fried foods and the fried chicken, Bill, you like subs. So, you know, the sub sandwich may not be that bad, but try to get it on whole wheat. But watch out for the fatty deli meats and the amount of salt that they put on it or the oil or the mayo. These may not be the healthiest of things that you can put on that. And these are very carb-rich, heavy rolls. So at least most places don't have whole meats. I mean whole wheat. But, you know, try to cut that out. Cut down on the processed meats in there. And some of the meats are pretty unhealthy, such as pepperoni, hot dogs, other processed meats. And sometimes they'll even throw bacon on. And it's categorized as a processed meat. So, you know, there's previous studies showing things like bacon. Four slices of bacon per week were linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease
