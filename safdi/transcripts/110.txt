Cheating Death to Live Longer
Episode: 110

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this evidence-based medicine podcast on wellness. I'm here today with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist. We're going to talk about living longer and cheating death. Alan, tell us what we can do to cheat death. You mean other than don't die? That's the main one. First of all, I have to apologize. Both of us have been on hiatus. We've been very busy with work. We apologize for not getting out any podcast for a period of time. It's interesting. Everybody says, I'm not going to live longer. My genes, I don't have good genes. I hear that all the time. I have bad genes. There's an interesting study that was published in August that looked at physical activity may have a much stronger role than genes in longevity. Just because your genes, people in your family haven't lived long in the past doesn't mean that you won't. We always want to go over with our physician our genetic history, which is a very important thing to go over. What is your family history going out a couple of generations and discussing that? Because there's lots of diseases that genetics make a big difference. But in regards to longevity as a whole, what we need to look at is some of these recent studies. And higher levels of light physical activity, you didn't have to do a lot or moderate vigorous physical activity, was associated with lower risk of death. If you sit a lot on your rear end... To me, that's all good news because my father died when he was 52. And it was just a sudden death. And I have several friends who had similar experiences who told me that, oh, they're not going to live, they're not going to live. And several of them are in their 70s right now. So, you know... Well, you know, and you've already beaten that, Bill, because you have good behaviors. You know, our behaviors make a big difference. The foods we eat, our activity, you know, sitting on our rear end, that sedentary time was associated with higher risk of mortality. And these studies, I must say that they were done, it came from the Women's Health Initiative studies. And they're large studies, but I'm extrapolating this to men also. So, you know, given the aging population... Yeah, the Women Health Studies have like 50,000 people in it. So it's a real study. And they have rigorous controls. So it's actually a very well done medical study. Yeah, and it supports, you know, we have an aging adult population. We spend way too much on health care when we have simple preventative things. And, you know, the more time we spend engaging in lower intensity activity, the study found support recommendations that this physical activity of almost any intensity can reduce the risk of disease and premature death. So let's talk about other things in regards, you know, to physical activity. You know, what kind of physical activity are we talking about? Well, there's what are the, you know, we've talked about this in the past. There's multiple types of exercise. You know, there's aerobic activity, which this study actually stressed was, you know, taking a walk, doing something, bike riding. But what about strength training, another type of exercise? We'll get into balance training, which all of us needs to be doing. And then stretching, yoga, meditation, those kinds of exercise also. But strength training, there was an interesting study, and it's almost been, you know, probably a week or two ago that it came out that people who lift weights, you know, essentially they're playing the long game. They're doing much better. You know, there's some newbie type gains, the quick and exciting increases in muscle strength, and you might look better. But, you know, there's some long-term gains, and there's a growing body of research that shows resistance training adds years to both lifespan and a healthy lifespan, the period of life when we're in good health. There was a study that was published from Japanese researchers, muscle strengthening activities to 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality. So do you have to lift a lot of weights? No. But we have to get aerobic training. We have to keep our muscles in shape for a variety of reasons. This resistance exercise was linked to lower risk of just not cardiovascular disease death, which we expected, but also cancer deaths were reduced by 12%, and diabetes, which is really an epidemic in our society, was reduced by 17%. And we'll do some – we have a lot of new evidence in regards to diabetes, and we'll discuss that in a future podcast. So basically – Well, that's a good thing. You know, we've always known that doing lifting exercises, especially for women, it's been well shown that it reduces their incidence of osteoporosis and reduces their risk of hip fractures. And we've always thought that it would probably help – I've always thought it would probably help with longevity. But that's great to hear that some actual studies are showing it. But let's talk about the weight. How much weight do you have to lift? I mean, I know you were going to talk about that. We're not sure, first of all. I mean, the strength training prescription typically in the past involved a lot of sets, you know, three per exercise, so moderate reps, you know, 8 to 12 repetitions of that weightlifting per set, and a relatively heavy weight. Also, I always recommended if they were doing that, at least initially, to get professional supervision and a well-equipped gym. But that, you know, one, it's unappealing to a lot of people, and it's impractical. So what we've really learned is that even lower intensity strength training, even a few reps with lighter weights without a lot of specialized equipment, somebody can buy 5, 3, 5, 10-pound weights and do very well. And sometimes doing them slower is better than doing them faster. You know, any type of resistance exercise was linked to lower mortality when we look at large populations. And, you know, how much strength training should you do? First of all, always discuss things with your physician before you do any of these things. But the maximum longevity benefit comes from one or two resistance exercise sessions a week. And that may total a total of 30 minutes a week. And it doesn't take a lot. And we'll discuss some of these more interesting studies, which are too small right now, where even a couple, you know, a few minutes of resistance training may improve one's longevity. So, you know, consider adding that to your regimen. And the last thing, you know, your dementia risk may be tied also. So we've talked about cardiovascular health, cancer health, resistance training, and now we're going to talk a little bit dementia risk tied to your daily step count. And that's very interesting. You know, dementia, which is another epidemic we have with an aging population, can drop by 25% as little as 3,800 steps per day. That's a minimum number of steps. I mean, it's something that everybody can accomplish. And this was from a UK biobank study from the United Kingdom. And looking at, you know, the highest dementia risk reduction, you know, occurred at about 9,826 steps. But there was a reduction even at 3,826 steps per day and a significant reduction. So it was half the maximum reduction, but it still was a significant reduction. So, you know, everybody should be getting out there to exercise. You know, these studies suggest that population-wide dementia prevention may be improved by shifting away from the least active end of the step count distributions, you know, to a little bit more aggressive ones. But, you know, these are not difficult goals. It's not difficult for people to add some resistance training, even with very small amounts of weight, ignoring some of the previous recommendations where we had people doing lots and lots of reps with heavier weights, but doing slower reps with really good form. So you're going to benefit your heart, your brain, and your longevity. And we don't want to just cheat death. We want to live a healthier, productive life, not just, you know, live a long life. We're very good as physicians keeping people alive for long periods of time, but we want viable years, not just years, where people are really healthy and vibrant for the rest of their lives. So hopefully this helps, and we will discuss some of the other aspects of exercise in future podcasts. Well, Alan, again, another great podcast. If you like the evidence-based medicine, please subscribe to our channel and tell your friends about it. Alan, thank you again. Thank you, and everybody, I do apologize for our hiatus over the summer. Take care.
