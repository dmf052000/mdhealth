Blood types and Covid-19
Episode: 048

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in what we think is the best podcast in evidence-based medicine on the web today. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internist. Alan, I want to talk to you about COVID-19 and blood types. As you know, the O-positive blood type is the most common in Caucasians. It's about 37% and African Americans is about 47%. The A-positive is about 33% in Caucasians and 24% in African Americans. And there have been some articles saying that O-positive is protective and A-positive may lead to increased risk of being on a respirator with COVID. Do you have any information for that? Yeah, Bill, you know, that's a good question because people have written in to us and called us saying, look, I have O-positive, so I am not going to get SARS-CoV-2, which is COVID-19. That's absolutely fallacious. That's like saying I don't have a genetic predisposition to breast cancer. I'm not BRCA positive, so I'm not going to get breast cancer. But as you and I know, and you probably know the data better than I, you know, about 85% of the breast cancers in the United States do not have a genetic predisposition. So saying that you have O-positive blood and it's protective is ridiculous. We all have to be extremely careful and diligent. Some of the greater risk factors are chronic health conditions, hypertension, obesity, age, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, diabetes. Those you should be careful, but every one of us has to be careful. We've both seen people dying in their 30s and 40s that have no risk factors. So, you know, part of this is not the actual blood type. The blood type is coded for on an actual gene. Two areas that code for your blood type are these multi-gene clusters on chromosome 3. And if you have those gene clusters and that genetic predisposition, you have a higher rate of respiratory failure if you have those gene clusters. It's about 1.77 times as much. And the blood type may be a marker for those. But people with any kind of blood type can have respiratory failure and death. You may not have a genetic predisposition to colon cancer, but you still have your colonoscopies, don't you, Bill? Yeah. I'd like to address some myths from our leaders, too, that this COVID-19 epidemic is over. That is complete nonsense. The COVID is probably going to be with us for at least two years. And that's assuming that we have a valid vaccine, hopefully by this winter. Do you want to comment on that, Alan? Yeah, I think that, you know, it's dangerous when leaders of our country tout hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as a wonder drug, and we find out that not only is it not beneficial, but it may be riskier. When they tell people this is over and they don't wear masks and they don't practice social distancing, and we'll talk about that in a subsequent podcast, of all the risks of that to our population, other countries are doing much better. We were waiting for the second peak this fall, and 19 or 20 states right now, we're starting to see a second peak already, which really scares the heck out of me. We need to be diligent. This is not that hard to control if we practice the measures that our leaders are ignoring often. So we have, this should be led by the scientists, Fauci and others. We need to listen to people with masters of public health that really understand this disease. But I agree with you completely, Bill, that this is not over. We haven't tackled this. We expect it to go down in the summertime, but this is not something that's gone away. It hasn't gone away, and it's not going away right now. All right. Thank you, Alan. And people, let me just remind you, if you like our podcast, please like it and tell your friends about it. This is evidence-based medicine, and our only goal is to give actual information, science-based information out to the public. Thank you, Bill.
