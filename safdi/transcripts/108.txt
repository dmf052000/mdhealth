Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining me in this podcast on evidence-based medicine. I'm here today with world-famous gastroenterologist and nutritionist, Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie, let's talk about sleep. I know it's important for people, and as I get older, I have more and more trouble sleeping. Give me some information about sleep. Well, Bill, we'll get into some of the recent studies and more epidemiologic data rather than a true study. But more than about a third of Americans, you're not unusual, are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis and report sleeping less than seven hours daily. And that was from the CDC. So you're not unusual. A lot of people, especially as they get older, have trouble sleeping. But getting enough sleep is really important. It keeps our immune system functioning smoothly, even decreases your risk of a myocardial infarction, a heart attack. Sleep is important to decrease your risk of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic health conditions. And previously we said studies show adults both, you know, whether you're young, whether you're old, or in between, you know, need somewhere between seven to nine hours of sleep. And a recent study looked at seven hours being the sweet spot, and we'll get into that data because it's really, if somebody sleeps eight hours, I don't want them to worry about it. If they sleep six and a half hours, I don't want them to worry about it. But sleeping too much is definitely not good, and sleeping too little is not good. So if we look, let's look at epidemiology first. And if we look around the world, the regions of the world where people live the longest, most of those areas they do sleep between seven and nine hours per night. And they take short naps if they're going to take naps. And we know that sleep helps by reducing stress load. It helps by reducing the risk of heart disease. Some studies all the way up to 34% in reduction. So, you know, how do you improve the ability to sleep? And part of the problem we have nowadays is we look at screens before we go to bed, which releases a light that may interfere with that. They watch television before going to bed. The old way was reading a book, reading an article. If people need sleep, listen to one of our podcasts, and they'll fall asleep very quickly. That would put anyone to sleep. So reading a book is healthier for you than for reading a screen or watching a TV. How long should you do that before you plan on going to bed? Well, part of it is creating a bedtime routine. A bedtime routine helps you fall asleep easier. And, you know, not going to bed at 10 o'clock one night and 1 a.m. the next night, you know, that really plays heck with our circadian rhythms. We may be less alert the next day. You know, for an hour or two before you go to bed, minimize, you know, disruptions. Minimize disruptions while you're sleeping. Decrease the amount of light within a bedroom. People that are exposed to more light and bright street lights and other things report more trouble going to sleep. So sleeping in a darker room helps in regards to secretion of melatonin. Light exposure at night disrupts our circadian rhythm and affects your levels of melatonin, which is our sleep hormone. So, but, you know, your question about disconnecting from electronic devices, whether it be a mobile phone or laptop or any of that, you know, at a minimum a half hour before you go to bed. You know, I say an hour for myself that I don't look at those for an hour before I go to bed, and I can fall asleep in seconds. But, you know, I think that's really important that we take a look at that. Let's talk a little bit about this recent study because this made headlines everywhere. Did you see the study, you know, the amount of sleep that's optimal and minimal in old age? No, I didn't see that one. Okay. Well, it was a recent study, and, you know, the headlines made it into a lot of papers, but seven hours of sleep is optimal in middle and old age. And what they did is they looked at cognitive performance, you know, how well you can think, your mental health, and a variety of other factors. Did not look at some of the other things that I mentioned before, obesity, diabetes, some of these other health aspects. And it was a large study, and they examined people between the ages of 38 and 73 from a biobank in the U.K. And the data came out of the U.K. and China, and they figured out it was kind of a U-shaped curve. You fall off, if you imagine upside down U, at the top of that U, you're doing really well. You know, seven hours was the top of that U. You know, seven to nine, still pretty close to the top of the U. But insufficient sleep and excessive sleep were associated with impaired cognitive performance, you know, whether too much or too little. But seven hours of sleep, at least for cognitive performance, not for myocardial infarctions, not for some of these other side effects, looked to be the best. What are the problems with the studies? Everybody reads the headlines and said, okay, you know, I shouldn't get just four hours sleep. I shouldn't get, you know, I shouldn't get over 10 hours sleep. You know, that's bad. And they adjusted for a lot of variables in this, but really monitored just cognitive performance. So when you're looking at this article, think of cognitive performance. Don't think of myocardial infarction, obesity, diabetes, you know, has a much bigger leeway, mainly between six and a half and eight and a half hours of sleep would be fine. Yeah, a lot of people call me and ask me about they're able to go to sleep, but then they wake up about after four hours, like three o'clock or four o'clock in the morning, they can't get back to sleep. What about those people? What should they do? Well, that's not uncommon also. You know, part of it is taking a look at their, you know, the routine, what they do, you know, realizing that sleep is one of the biggest risk factors for chronic disease. So it's really important that we get, you know, enough sleep. You know, I usually use, as you've given me in the past, we sleep in an extremely dark room. There are no lights. It's perfectly dark. Some people talk about melatonin. Other people say, you know, to get to sleep, you drink a warm glass of milk before you go to bed. You know, there's all kinds of these different things. If you wake up at four o'clock, should you take a half of a melatonin or, you know, three milligrams of melatonin? Is that helpful? You know, what are your thoughts about that? Well, melatonin, first of all, is a normal hormone, but it is not a sleeping pill. And it can leave people groggy the next day. It's great for changing time zones, especially when I fly overseas or giving lectures other places in different time zones. The amount your body produces is a tiny, tiny amount. And the amount sold in these pills is a very large amount. And there are potential side effects for this. I really like the idea of not having to rely on melatonin or other aids to get to sleep. You don't need less sleep when you get older. We need just as much sleep as we did previously. And, you know, we don't want to just focus on this cognitive decline and dementia. We want to focus on everything, whether it be anxiety, depression. You know, what you can do, as I mentioned before, some people eat a large meal late at night. That can trigger reflux. It wakes them up. It might even be silent heartburn that wakes them up at night. So, you know, decreasing your large meals, you know, as in a lot of the blue zones, the larger meals in the middle of the day. Making sure blue light and electronics, which suppress melatonin, are avoided. So you can make your own melatonin. And as I said, I do that for at least an hour before I go to sleep. And that means not, you know, reading on a tablet. If you want to read, read on a book in a dimly lit room. Not watching television and close to bedtime, which most people do, which suppresses melatonin. So we can make our own melatonin. Not getting heartburn. Get in daytime exercise. Exercise boosts the effect of sleep hormones like melatonin, especially if it's done in bright daylight, you know, during the day. There was a study years ago. I think it's been probably almost 13 or 14 years ago. In 2010, they found that people, older people, in which I hate to mention 55 and older, they called them older people, who exercise about four times a week for about a half hour had easier time falling asleep than those who did not exercise. You know, set yourself up for sleep. Make sure the room's not too hot. Dim the lights. Make sure your bedroom is cool, not hot. I mean, the hotter we sleep better when it's a little bit cooler. And, you know, some people like white noise machines or wave machines or other things to keep themselves awake. And if you do wake up, don't worry about it. Don't become anxious. That's not uncommon for people to wake up at night. And one of the problems, some people take exceptionally long naps during the day, and then they're not going to sleep as well. You know, sleeping pills, you know, are somewhat dicey in my opinion. And I am
