Can eating chocolate help prevent Covid-19?

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining us on this podcast on evidence-based medicine, what we think is the best podcast in America on medicine. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-famous gastroenterologist and internal medicine doctor. We're answering questions from people about COVID-19. Here's from one listener, Alan. So I eat a candy bar, a chocolate bar every day. Someone said that was a good idea. Kind of an interesting question. What do you think? Well, I think it tastes good, but unfortunately, most chocolate bars, if it's like a Hershey bar, it's predominantly sugar. And sugar is not that beneficial for us in any respect for any disease process. So I think what they're getting to is some studies, the studies of cocoa, using that in our armaterian against COVID-19 and other viruses. For one, it has a really favorable safety profile. I have not seen too many overdoses on cocoa compared to... Sometimes I worry my wife might overdose on chocolate, but go ahead. Yeah, I may overdose on chocolate, but I only eat dark chocolate and 72% or above in dark, not 50%. But compared to some experimental therapies like hydroxychloroquine that carries a huge number of adverse risks, which was pushed by politicians and has turned out not to be beneficial, at least so far, this may have some benefit. How much, we're not sure. I mean, studies, unfortunately, are few and far between, but studies have investigated the efficacy of cocoa, ranging from 10% cocoa extract intake daily, taking it twice a day. But less than one standard dark bar of chocolate per week can offer a host of benefits, at least in most of these studies. So a few small pieces a day may be reasonable. So the question is, why could this be reasonable? So there's a lot of natural compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, anthocyanins that we know have been used as treatments not to prevent viral infections, but to help with our immune protection. And one of the substances, or a couple of them, and there is resveratrol, which everybody's heard of from red wine, but also occurs in cocoa quite a bit and in whole foods, and anthocyanins. So cocoa consumption has been shown to have a positive effect on our immune system, our immune system's inflammatory innate response, so we don't over-respond or under-respond. And it helps us in our intestines, which is really at the heart of our immune system often, and in our bloodstream, the systemic part. And it has to do with diets rich in cocoa enhances our T cell function, which is one of our main mediators of immunity. And it leads to the formation of these systemic, meaning in our bloodstream, antibodies and in our gut, in our gastrointestinal tract, antibodies. So I think they're tremendously beneficial. There's been previous studies with anthocyanins, which are antioxidants in the cocoa seed, but also in your blueberry, your blackberry, your strawberry. These are these pigments that we see in those. They're helpful in regards... I think I eat about 10 blueberries a day, just so I get a good dose of those antioxidants. Yeah, I think that's reasonable. And we can talk about why you're eating 10 blueberries a day. Maybe that's going to help with your T cell function, your T helper cells. But it may also help in regards to our brain function. It may help in regards to cardiovascular disease. The Nurse Health Study, people that took in 25 milligrams of anthocyanins a day, which is about your 10 blueberries per day, had a much lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. So these bright fruits and colors and cocoa, and one of the most consumed antioxidants is coffee. Unfortunately, that doesn't have the anthocyanins in it. But we think these anthocyanins, they're really mighty. Think of them as mighty antioxidants running around your body, scavenging up free radicals that can damage you and mitigating the effects of these reactive oxygen species. So during the course of an infection, white blood cells are activated and these free radicals are produced. The antioxidants in cocoa can neutralize some of these free radicals. So a little bit of chocolate a day is great. It makes me feel good after I have my blueberries for dessert. Not a Hershey bar, not a candy bar. I luckily love dark chocolate. So often I have 80 to 90% dark, but most people can't stand it that dark. Remember the percentage, if it's 72% dark chocolate, there's 28% of it that is not dark chocolate and often sugar. And a regular candy bar, there's very little cocoa from the cacao plant. So good question. I think a reasonable thing, especially when you're stuck inside, to add to your diet. Yeah, and so for our listeners, dark chocolate candy bar at least once a week. And I think chocolate just tends to make all of us happy in these stressful times.
