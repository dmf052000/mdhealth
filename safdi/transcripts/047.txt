When is Covid-19 going to end?
Episode: 047

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. William Renner. Thank you for joining us in what we think is the best podcast in medicine, Evidence-Based Medicine Today. I'm here with Dr. Alan Safdie. Dr. Safdie and I have been doing clinical research for over 30 years and published multiple peer-reviewed articles. Dr. Safdie has been featured on Medical Crossfire. He speaks nationally and internationally. We both continue to give continuing medical education lectures to physicians throughout the world. Dr. Safdie, let's talk about COVID-19. When is it going to end? Unfortunately, Bill, it's really impossible to predict with any accuracy because it's a novel virus. So we don't know when we're going to see the end of this really horrific pandemic of COVID-19. Let me go out a little bit on a limb and predict that this is going to go on for another two years or until such time that we have a herd immunity, meaning a lot of people already have gotten and have neutralizing antibodies. Not just antibodies, but neutralizing antibodies that can effectively neutralize the virus. Antibodies and neutralizing antibodies are somewhat different. So we either have to have those kind of herd immunity or mass vaccination without a lot of people that are anti-vaxxers. But currently we're fighting a lethal enemy with our hands tied behind our backs. We don't have a vaccine that's safe or effective. We don't have a treatment that's safe or effective. Contrary to what some people might say, hydroxychloroquine is neither effective nor safe. And we have totally insufficient non-invasive rapid testing. I don't care what anybody says. I challenge any of you to know where you can drive up today and get a test for antibodies and get a test for the virus. Two different types of tests if you want to listen to our previous podcast. So I think it's going to be going on some time, you know, social distancing is an effective tool, but it comes with a high price tag. Well, what bothers me is this, I think it's starting to become acceptable to have a huge number of deaths. As we talked earlier, maybe a thousand deaths a day. Can you imagine that even during the Vietnam War when we would have sometimes five or 10 deaths a day, how outraged everyone is. And now we're having a thousand, some days with a thousand deaths a day. Yet people are outraged that we're not about the huge number of deaths. They're outraged because they're supposed to wear masks. They're outraged because they don't want to do social distancing. They're outraged because if they sit in the bar, they can't be sitting next to anybody. No, you're right, Bill. There's actually a thousand to 2,000 deaths a day might be politically acceptable right now. You know, neither one of us have a crystal ball. So I think that's difficult, but we're facing a long-term simmer of this disease, not boiling over, hopefully, but a simmer until we get that effective vaccination. And again, having a vaccine and an effective vaccination are two different things. Or effective, inexpensive treatment. So I really wish this didn't play out in the press sometimes, the treatments. I wish it actually played out in the scientific community. It should not play out in the political community or in the press. And this should be analyzed by people that understand medicine. So we understand how difficult it is to predict the end of this pandemic. And we realize that the current stay-at-home orders aren't going to work, but distancing can work. We can't drastically overwhelm the healthcare capacity in some regions of this country. So we are going to have this simmering until we have this durable herd immunity where two-thirds of the population or 75% of the population is immune. And that's going to take a while. All right, Alan. Again, thank you for those brilliant insights. If you like our podcast, please subscribe and tell your friends about our podcast. Thank you.
