Weight lifting helps to prevent dementia
Episode: 132

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Dr. William Renner, and it's my pleasure to host this series of podcasts on evidence-based medicine with Dr. Alan Safdie. I'm the Emeritus Director of Radiology at the Ohio GI and Liver Institute. Dr. Alan Safdie is Chief Medical Officer of Quadrant Health, owned by Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Safdie served as Chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Gastroenterology at the Deaconess Hospital and Ohio GI Liver Institute, and has been elected President of the Ohio Gastroenterology Society. Dr. Safdie has been the primary investigator in more than 200 medical studies and co-investigator in more than 800 studies. Alan, let's talk about an interesting article that talked about weight training protecting the brain from dementia. You know, can lifting dumbbells lift your memory too? Maybe you could summarize that article for us. It's an interesting study, Bill, and I sure hope so, because I do weight training three times a week and have done it for decades and I will continue to do it. And, you know, we've always known that regular exercise is a known modifiable risk factor for dementia. There is really no excuse. It's probably the best medication we have is to do regular exercise, and the second best is nutrition. And this is an interesting study that suggested that weight training may help protect the brains of older adults who already have some cognitive impairment. What they did is they took 44 adults ages 55 or older with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. If you think that's uncommon, it's not. It's an extremely common problem in the adult and older population. We think at least one out of three, probably more, individuals in the older population have mild cognitive impairment. So they took these and divided them in groups, which you always want to look at. If you're looking at a study, always look and see if the study is well done. So they took one group and they participated in resistance training. It doesn't have to be with heavy weights. Twice a week, not then with progressive loads, meaning weights or sets were increased as participants' muscle strength and so the gastroenteric was increasing their resistance. And they also did moderate to high intensity training too, just not light weights. But yeah, go ahead. And so what they did is they're looking at the greater the muscle. So what it's actually really looking at, the greater the muscle mass associated with lower risk of dementia and better cognitive function. So in the past, we've seen it. So why is that? Well, weight training helps protect certain areas of our brain. And there's certain areas of our brain that really, well, all areas of our brain are important. But the verbal and episodic memory areas have improved the strength of the neurons. It improved how these neurons talk to each other. You know, as you exercise, you get release of things called brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other areas really help in regards to your cells communicating. And it made the way of progression of even preventing onset of dementia in these people. So yeah, and as a radiologist, I found it fascinating that it even changed white matter structures seen on MR examination. So we can actually see the changes. So a significant amount of change in my mind. No, and I think you're absolutely right, Bill. That's really important. Not only, you know, because in a study, there can be investigator bias, but there's not when it's a blinded radiologist looking at their MRs, you know, we're looking at their cognitive function, their attention, their supported memory. You know, we're looking at all those things. And one of the fascinating things, it could even reverse in a couple of these people. They showed improvement in cognitive health after the intervention. And these weren't years of intervention. So yeah, as I remember, there's five participants who didn't even have, who completely came back to normal after six months of weight training. Yeah. And they no longer tested positive for dysfunction. So, you know, people, you know, if you improve insulin sensitivity, that makes a difference. If you have increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, that makes a difference, which support the growth and survival of neurons. If you improve blood flow, which you're going to do, there's not one kind of exercise you should do. You should do about four different types of exercises. We're going to do. But as you improve blood flow, you improve cardiovascular health and cerebral blood flow into your brain. So these physiologic changes that you can see in this, you know, improved. So we want to, you know, in our communities as a whole, we want to decrease obesity. We want to improve cardiovascular health in people. We want to reduce the diabetes risk. We want to have more brain-derived neurotrophic factor. And it has tremendous strength besides just we used to talk about bone density, that it improved bone density. Yes, that's another benefit of this. But this is not only improving bone density, but it's improving your cerebral function and brain regions controlling memory and thinking. Alan, I'd like to hear about the exercises they did. So, you know, resistance, and you don't have to do this. So reading a study, don't think that you have to do what they did because they didn't have a low dose, you know, exercise. We have studies in rats where we have rats that did weight training. And people go, how do the rats lift barbells? They do not. They tie weights to the rat and they go up inclines. And that's how they did the weight training in rats. We have rats that do continuous exercise on a wheel. We have rats that are sedentary. All of them improve things in the brain. So, and in those we can even get more detailed neurological examinations and mechanics in these populations. So resistance training can be with any sort of, you know, barbells that you have. Bands are fine if you're doing resistance training. But if you're doing resistance training, also do aerobic training, whether you walk, whether you bike, whether you run, whether you hike. Get off your rear ends. You know, those are very important things that we need to do. So, you know, what is, you know, what we want to do is if you exercise, you're going to build muscle mass, maybe by 1% per month for a while, and then you'll plateau out. But it helps in the older populations help preserve independence, reduces fall risk. You have more fat loss and better body composition. You increase your metabolic rate. You improve your bone density. You improve your insulin sensitivity. You improve your heart health. You improve mental health and cognition and decrease the risk of depression. Multiple studies showing that. So, you know, what we want to do is if you exercise, you're going to build muscle mass, maybe by 1% per month for a while, and then you'll plateau out.
