Omega-3: The Good, the bad, and the ugly.
Episode: 098

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, this is Dr. Bill Renner. I myself am board certified in internal medicine and radiology. I'm very pleased to be hosting a podcast on evidence-based medicine and wellness with Dr. Alan Safdie, world-renowned nutrition physician and gastroenterologist. Dr. Safdie has been involved in more than 900 clinical research studies. He's authored more than 300 clinical research studies. This is the second in a series of podcasts on omega-3s. Please listen to the first podcast. And as always with all our podcasts, please talk to your own doctor before you take any additional medicine supplements or anyone else's advice. Alan, let's continue our talk on omega-3s. It's fascinating what we talked about before. What can you tell us about the downsides of omega-3? Well, you know, Bill, that's a good question. As we mentioned at the end of the previous podcast, almost everything can have a downside. You know, I see people taking mega-dose vitamins all the time and people call with questions on mega-dose vitamins. And a lot of them do have a downside. So too much of anything can have a downside. But let's talk a little bit about, you know, I left right at the end and left a little cliffhanger about, you know, higher levels of these omega-3s in the blood. You know, they may increase your life expectancy. And a study that was published just recently on omega-3s showed a 1% increase in this substance in the blood was associated with a change in death, mortality, similar to that of quitting smoking. So omega-3s are extremely important. Yeah, I mean, that's a dramatic benefit, you know. Yeah, I mean, that's probably one of the most impressive things I've seen. And it was a good study because they measured in blood. They didn't just do historical, you know, how much walnuts do you take in, you know, how much fish do you eat. It was well done. It was Hospital Del Mar Medical Research Institute. And it was in collaboration with the Fatty Acid Research Institute in the United States and several other universities in the U.S. as well as Canada. So it was published in a well-respected journal, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. And so I'm really impressed with that data. And it was monitored over 11 years. And they analyzed data on blood fatty acid levels in over 2,240 people over age 65. So does that mean it's the fatty acids that's making them live longer? Or maybe there's something else, the people that have higher omega-3s have other lifestyle changes that help them live longer. So you always have to be careful in research that is it directly correlated or is it a side effect of lifestyle? So people that have the most omega-3s may have the most plant-based diet. They may do more exercise. So there's other factors, although this was well-controlled for diet and other things. But I think it was very good. Again, they used red blood cell fatty acid fingerprint to predict this all-cause death rates in these patients. So it's beneficial. Do you have to get your omega-3s only from fish? Absolutely not. I'm a vegetarian, as you know, and I don't eat fish. So it does bother me a little bit. So I take alpha-linolenic acid, which converts over to EPA and DHA. It has to go through a conversion step. And it's a plant-based way of getting omega-3s in there. But I eat lots of foods that have omega-3s also. Do you eat walnuts or anything like that, Bill? Yeah, I eat walnuts every day. I try to eat a few walnuts. And I also take a supplement. I just started taking it a few years ago when there was all the hype on cardiology. My cardiologist said he thought it would be a good idea. So I started taking omega-3s. I don't take them as religiously as I used to, but most days I'll take a supplement. But I would like to talk about doses later in the talk, too, because I don't know if I'm getting enough omega-3s by just taking one capsule a day. Well, that's a good question. I mean, really, we want to get our nutrition from whole foods for the most part. So I'm happy that you're eating walnuts. There was actually a study, which was a study, the Walnuts and Healthy Aging Study. And it was published probably a year, year and a half ago. And they looked at consumption in healthy elderly adults. And they looked at cognitive decline in those or cognitive function over two years. And it had a better effect on elderly adults who smoked and had a lower baseline neuropsychological test score. So, you know, just simple things like maybe adding walnuts to the diet, adding other foods, chia seeds. Yeah, I mean, ever since those studies came down on walnuts, I always try to eat a little bit of walnuts every day. I try to eat 10 blueberries a day. I try to take fish oil. And I'm kind of a modified vegetarian, you know. I do eat occasional chicken because I just worry about the protein content. Yeah, I mean, I hope people will take our advice. You know, there's not one single thing one can do in a nutritional aspect that's ideal. It's the synergistic effect of all parts of our lifestyle and all parts of our nutrition. So just getting, you know, if you have a lousy diet and take a fish oil capsule, you're not going to benefit. It's, you know, and you don't have to have fish oil or fish oil capsules. You can put chia seeds like I do in my oatmeal every morning. You can put flaxseed, which I do every single morning. You can have nuts, which have a fair amount of omega-3s such as walnuts in them. You can take an alpha-linolenic acid one. But, you know, let's talk, you know, you mentioned, you know, we mentioned that it may increase life expectancy. But, you know, are there other problems that you perceive with this ever, Bill? With taking fish oil? Yeah. No, I'm not certain what you're talking about, what you're hinting at. Yeah. Well, I mean, there was studies in regards to heart rhythm. And that's one of the things that, you know, we are a little concerned about, you know, is can this precipitate arrhythmias or irregular heartbeats? So that's why we say talk to your doctors. So if you're taking very high doses and you're taking it based upon, you know, whether you wanted to take it to lower your lipid profile or other things. But there was a study, the omega-3 supplements are associated with an increase, not a decrease, likelihood of atrial fibrillation, this irregular heart rate, and people that were taking it with very high blood lipid levels. Again, we need more studies to document this. So people with arrhythmias or especially a history of atrial fibrillation, always talk to your doctor about these things. Yeah, that's very important. I mean, both of us have been in clinical medicine for years and years and years. And I know of patients who carry around a box, you know, like a fishing box full of supplements who literally was taking hundreds of supplements a day. You don't want to be one of those individuals. You know, if you're going to take these supplements, first talk to your doctor and take them within the dosage that the articles and the studies recommend. Don't take, you know, don't think that if one dose is good, two doses is better. You know, it's like lots of medicine, like aspirin we've talked about before. Very small doses of aspirin can be very beneficial, while very high doses of aspirin can cause serious bleeding and ulceration. It's just like kidney medicine. Just, you know, you have to use common sense and always remember that if one's good, two is not necessarily better. Do you agree, Alan? No, I agree with you completely. I mean, and we know that. We've done enough studies on these things to know that excessive amounts of even B-complex vitamins may actually be very bad for you. Not enough of those may be very bad for you also. One of the things I forgot to mention, you know, it's worthwhile is, you know, omega-3s really can help fight inflammation. Remember, try to get most of these from dietary sources, but they do block some of these inflammatory cascades that are in our bodies. And so, you know, can omega-3s reduce chronic inflammation, which can contribute to heart disease, cancer, and other various diseases? Absolutely, we think it can. You know, can it help fight autoimmune diseases? You know, there are studies that omega-3s can help fight several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease and things. But, you know, there's tons of studies we need to do. We're looking at mental disorders, mental decline, Alzheimer's disease, as you mentioned previously. You know, are these omega-3s going to help prevent these age-related mental decline? We need much more research on a lot of these things. We need much more nutritional research. But please, you know, there's very little downside of getting your omega-3s in dietary sources. But if you have an arrhythmia, you know, absolutely talk to your doctor beforehand. In regards to dosing, you know, I usually try to tell people, if you're going to take a supplement, aim in the middle. Don't look at how much fish oil concentrate is in there because that's not the important part. It's how many omega-3 fatty acids. So they'll be listed on your supplement. Say, you know, it might be over 300 milligrams of EPA. It could be 324. It could be over 400, depending on, you
