Thank You Teresa and the Historical
Museum and thank you to the Mountain Club for that Via Ferrata piece
I'm here with dr. Alan Safdi. Alan, thank you very much for coming in and joining
us. Thank you for having me. And we're gonna talk about gastroenterology and
we're gonna talk about your work in health and wellness, but I'm first gonna
ask you a question that we like to ask a lot of our guests, which is what's your
Telluride story? How did you come to find yourself here in Telluride? That's
an interesting story 30-something years ago
I've been married for 41 years and we went everywhere to ski. One year my wife
heard from somebody let's try Telluride and the Mountain
Village essentially didn't exist then, it was 30 maybe 32 years ago and we came
here. We've never skied anywhere since so we came for the winter now we love the
summer even more so than the winter we bought a place up in Mountain Village and
there was only a few buildings here, no gondola, no hotels, and you know we love
it, love this small town. Came for the skiing, stayed for the summers, the fall?
Oh yeah. And it's ... the older I get, the summer is
more attractive to me than the wintertime although I love them all. Yeah, well it's
interesting that you mention this issue of aging because I want to talk to you a
little bit about that but first of all for those of us who aren't in the know
particularly about what gastroenterology even is I know it has to do with the
digestive system with disorders and health of the digestive system so I
guess that's everything from where you put the food in to where the food comes
out and everything in between right? It's almost all parts of your body so even
the heart we're interested in because that can affect the gastrointestinal
tract or the gastrointestinal tract can affect your heart so we deal with the
esophagus, oropharyngeal area, stomach, intestines, liver,  pancreas, spleen; so
everything below the diaphragm, all those all those organs, but also you
know I trained in nutrition right so... And they go together? They go absolutely
together, unfortunately gastroenterologists have gotten more
attuned to just doing colonoscopies and not sitting down and talking to people
about what are you consuming how much are you exercising what can we do to prevent
disease, not just treat disease. Because it's those organs that are processing
and extracting all the nutrients and giving you your energy. Right, and we have
a significant increase—I can look at your liver function test, but now we have
a significant increase in fatty livers and abnormal liver function tests,
secondary to foods we eat— not in Telluride but other parts of the
country, increasing weights we're noticing. We have ultra processed food. So
we're not only interested in diagnosing and treating pre-existing disorders, but
at least in my my focus has been how do we prevent disorders including not just
gastrointestinal tract disorders including dementia including heart
disease; so including every part of your body, even looking at osteoporosis and
you know decreased bone density in osteopenia not enough bone density. So we
actually put together a little series of talks by Dr. Allen and his sidekick Dr.
Bill on dementia, on preventative measures that can serve to help reduce
the risk or reduce the incidence of dementia; we're going to show one of
those after this interview, but for now I want to talk about some of the things that you've talked about with us here and on that series about health and
wellness as it has to do with nutrition I have a friend, a man who lived well
into his 90s, who said that the keys to a healthy long life for him
were blueberries and compromise and I thought it was classic and I wonder how
how much you subscribe to that theory? Blueberries is one probably the best
fruits one could consume absolutely it doesn't have to be a blueberry, it could
be a blackberry, it could be a plum— anything with these anthocyanins in it
and those decrease. We have a study that giving a placebo of blueberries versus
true blueberries we have to make a new powder because you can't have a blueberry placebo—it would be like chewing a marble, you would know what you're eating so we have
to have a powder and put it in a pill. But even after 16 weeks of the
blueberries the cognitive function improved in humans not just our rats or
mice but in humans so this individual is
absolutely correct; and compromise, decreasing stress levels, not worrying
about everything you see in the news that's one of the benefits of being here
I don't hear the news all day because my commute is walking or biking. When I
drive to a hospital my commute is listening to Sirius radio and I'm
listening to news channels, so. I think a lot of people discount this whole
holistic approach because they think it's so much mumbo-jumbo mysticism but
it seems to me that the the mind and the body are just inextricably bound, that they affect one another. Absolutely yeah I mean if you look at the populations that live the longest
in the world they predominantly eat a plant-based diet, not solely, but some of
them are solely like the seventh-day adventists solely plant-based diets. They
exercise, not necessarily in the gym, but as you do in Telluride you exercise by
walking by walking to the gondola, to a gondola you know your whole life is
consistent with regular activity but the social interactions are extremely
important in all those populations. The older people are revered, not discounted, which to me is really important right now they older I get. I mean, they
look to people that have wisdom and they're incorporated into the family
structures and they don't have a lot of stress you know some of them do yoga
some do other things but they decrease stress levels by the compromise and
interestingly two out of three of those larger populations have empowered women,
which I think is extremely important and listening to you know having all
portions of the population being listened to. I remember listening to a
speaker at one of the Mountainfilm festivals who was talking about the
blue zones, these places where people tend to have the best longevity and
there was a particular community in the Mediterranean I can't remember if it was
Italy or Greece or somewhere but there were certain component parts of their
diet like oregano and sardines and an olive oil that seemed to be important
but one of the most important factors was that they all came together as a
community regularly like every day and they all they came to a Taverna or
whatever it was and they drank red wine together and they had
a really really good festive time on a very regular basis and that was just
part of their lifestyle. Fun, and decreasing—you know, and inter
generational. Yes bringing everybody together. Even when we get out and do
forest bathing and we're taking a walk here our cortisols go down, our blood
pressure goes down, our blood pressure goes down with exercise, bringing people
together to decrease stress. You know often that's very important and we
discount that completely and unfortunately in medicine we don't have
time to look at every aspect of somebody's life that we really should be
looking at; we get paid when you get sick Right. I don't get paid when you're
healthy, which is the exact opposite of what it should be.
Well before we before we go to this clip of yours on dementia I'd like you to if
you would talk to us a little bit just as an oversight about how diet, nutrition,
exercise can serve to eliminate the incidence of dementia. There's lots of
things we can do let's just look at exercise initially; those in the top
quartile of fitness and in their 50s may have, depending on the study, 25 to 50
percent decrease of dementia in their lifetime. Those that take in good healthy
nutrients the anthocyanins and the blueberries or the blackberries or the
strawberries or the plums, may have a decrease in regards to dementia in those
groups, so those are extremely important we know at least in animal studies that
if we incorporate cinnamon into the diet it actually helps neuroplasticity the
ability for cells to talk to each other and that's what we run. It's so cool, all
these different things. Turmeric, as long as you get one that's not watered down
with lead, right, and there are some problems with some of the
Bangladesh ones right now. You know may benefit. Aggarwal and Gregory
Cole or doing things in regards to dementia and cancer prevention with
spices like that so it's extremely important to exercise you release
brain-derived neurotropic factor that make your cells talk to each other
better, we can grow new cells, we always thought "I'm the smartest I'm going to
be you know when I'm a kid," and every year
I'm gonna lose cells but as neurons, cells in my brain, the hippocampus and 
memory areas can actually increase themselves so we have rats ...
well, it works I mean we have rats you know you can teach to do weight lifting hard to get them to balance a barbell on
their hands, but actually you tie weights to them and they go up an incline or
interval rats that go very fast on a treadmill are ones that exercise
continuously for long periods of time. All the rats develop new cells in their
hippocampus and the memory portions of the brain the ones that exercise
continuously for longer periods had new cells teaming in the hippocampus or the
memory portions. You know as you're talking I'm remembering something that
always strikes me as a little odd and that's that when I was young there was a
the common wisdom was that certain foods really had very little nutritional value
including mushrooms including watermelon and including celery those are the ones
that I remember which now seem to be on the other end of the spectrum but some
of the most important things you can eat. Well it depends on what nutrients. We know
we can't take nutrients out of a carrot and make you healthier, and that
was one of the first studies I was ever involved in and unfortunately probably
hurt people rather than helping. We said, so ok, beta-carotene we'll put it in a
vitamin and we'll decrease the incidence cancer. No, we increased the incidence of
the cancers. Cancer cells need nutrients too so extra nutrients in regards to
vitamins you know there's certain vitamins we may
need such as vitamin D but judged by your family doctor but a lot of these
megadose vitamins are very harmful and then we discounted mushrooms. Mushrooms
may be extremely good for cognition you know, lion—not just any mushroom, actually
it's not just lion's mane or cordyceps but it's basically every mushroom we look at,
some are better than others, but every single mushroom may be better for the
brain. Certain products like celery may have nitrates in it to convert to
nitrites which convert to nitrous oxide that lower your blood pressure just
because it didn't have calories and we couldn't find a specific vitamin—we always
look for a vitamin and there's ... if there's no vitamin, forget it, but
there's thousands of phytochemicals beneficial chemicals
we've totally ignored in everything. And it is fascinating, I mean
every day I've learned so much and I'm really passionate about it. And you can
learn more because of your diet and your exercise. Well there isn't probably a day out
of the year that goes by it's unless I'm stuck on an airplane somewhere to go
lecture, that I don't try to exercise. So tell me this, Alan, are you—is there
something coming up in the way of Integrative wellness or health and
wellness another symposium because you've been involved in a few here in
Telluride is there something on the horizon that we could get people the
heads up about? I would love to do some more free ones for the community we just
had one at the library last week on last Wednesday night and we packed the
room without even advertising it. Just people that have come before when we did
the integrative wellness ones with Deepak Chopra, and other people that were
here in town and I'd like to give back to the community and do those on a
regular basis; sit down and discuss topical things that came out in the news
and why they may be wrong. I mean we've done lots of studies to show there
was a hundred and one studies many years ago we looked at, and look at them a decade
later, only five of those studies really meant anything we were wrong 96, 96 out of
of 101 times, so we’re wrong a lot why do I write a free newsletter that
anybody can get if they contact you, I mean, it’s free, we don’t accept
advertising or anything else it’s just something I do out of interest it’s
because often I have to change my thoughts in regards, doing you know,
just as we did before mushrooms are worthless—no mushrooms are beneficial, as is celery. Yeah facts are facts until they’re not. Yeah I love that about
the evidence is in, this little series that I was talking about before, because
as you said at the outset of that, you know, this isn’t for any personal gain
it’s not for you to help you in any way financially or with publicity it’s just
to give the facts as the evidence comes in, to let people know what that evidence
is. Listen we’re gonna  have to go now, but we will show…
we’ll show the clip so that people get a sense more of what you’re talking about
and I want to thank you very, very much. We will have 3-day seminars next year at
times, it depends on Telski to give us a room. We’ll get the word out. And I
love doing this so I’m happy to do or volunteer as much as
possible. I volunteer all over the world but it’s much nicer to volunteer where I
have a house! Thank you for having me I really appreciate it thank you.
